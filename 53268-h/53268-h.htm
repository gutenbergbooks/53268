<h2 id="c1">I</h2>
<p>Ordway Belknap, ex-Judge of the Magistrate&rsquo;s
Courts, and for the present a detective of
amateur standing, and a semi-professional criminologist,
on call at the Homicide Department,
leaned comfortably back in an arm-chair in the den
of his spacious penthouse apartment on the East
River&mdash;in Gracie Square to be exact. James,
the perfect &lsquo;man&rsquo; that confirmed bachelors dream
of one day possessing, entered soundlessly on the
deep-napped carpet, and, in a cotton-wool voice,
announced Judge Whittaker on the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, James,&rdquo; murmured Belknap in a
tone modulated to the atmosphere of the room;
while James, with the smooth precision of the
Roxy Orchestra being lowered, sank from view,
the den being a floor to itself.</p>
<p>Belknap slowly ground out a freshly lit cigarette
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
and meditatively examined the telephone at
his elbow. His face gathered seriousness as a window
gathers steam. He recalled Whittaker&rsquo;s remark
of a week ago, made as they passed at the
Club: &ldquo;I will give you a ring soon on a matter of
life and death. No, I can&rsquo;t go into it now&mdash;I&rsquo;m
running.&rdquo; And though in the meanwhile the matter
had slipped his mind he now unaccountably,
even to himself, hesitated to remove the receiver.</p>
<p>Belknap was a man of fifty-odd, but didn&rsquo;t
look it; tall, handsome, with a firm mouth, burning
brown eyes, and thick, lustrous black hair. His
muscles were steel-hard; and his skin always deeply
bronzed, winter and summer alike, for he was one
of those elusive and self-styled members of the
Long Beach nature club. He enjoyed motoring
down on brilliant days even in January to nurse a
driftwood fire in the shelter of a shallow dune,
basking himself in fire heat and violet ray.</p>
<p>Sun-bathing is the habit of a solitary; but
then, Belknap <i>was</i> a solitary in more ways than
one. He loved the slow, indolent afternoons, apparently
wasted, and with no words spoken. He
relished the mingled smell of olive oil, wood smoke
and salt; and the sight, through more than
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
half-shut eyes, of gulls, and a ship moving up the
horizon like the large hand of a clock, invisibly
moving yet seen to have moved. Rodney Drake
would periodically rise like an elongated Pict out
of the waste of sand and gesticulate against the sky.
On the open beach the hardy little Egyptian, name
unknown, would squat motionless on his heels over
a tin firebox.</p>
<p>So it may well have been these lonely watches
that fostered the thing in Belknap that his acquaintances,
even friends, called &lsquo;queer.&rsquo; The
world in general certainly considered him puzzling,
enigmatic. It found him definitely uncommunicative,
or, when communicative, ironic,
which is a turn of speech that leaves the hearer
not much the wiser. His friends claimed for him a
sensitive, reserved nature that shed humankind
with reluctant cynicism for lack of a better
method, a cynicism sharpened and brought to a
point through years of close association with the
evils and corruption, hypocrisy and injustice of
the courts. He had a way of never overlooking an
opportunity to be bitter at the expense of law and
order as practiced in this enlightened twentieth
century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>And it was the hopelessness of the struggle
to keep a modicum of honesty in the legal system
that, Belknap said, had driven him out to play a
lone wolf game tracking the criminal. Too frequently,
he claimed, the innocent paid, or no one
paid, while the guilty sat in full view of the Bench.
He was at least determined to give the eager public
a few real captures, if not convictions. In his two
most famous cases he had managed the convictions
as well.</p>
<p>His first, that of Maria Monroe, strangled in
her closed Riverside Drive apartment when it was
supposed she herself was in Honolulu, followed immediately
on his resignation from office. In fact
what he considered the bungling of this case had
been the last straw that made him yield to a temptation
of long standing. And he was miraculously
successful. With every investigating agency
in the City against him, and with an apparently
impregnable alibi to break down, he saw his man
through to the chair.</p>
<p>But it was the Stanton-Mowbray affair the
next winter that saw Belknap&rsquo;s amazing and unreasonable
technique developed to its greatest
power. Stanton was shot at the Villa Bella Night
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Club in Forty-eighth Street, West, toward the daybreak
closing of an exceptionally wild night. No
gun was found, although the few remaining guests
were searched within a few moments by the police;
and even the general direction from which the
shot was fired could not be determined. Some said
it had come through a window, others from close
range. The case had lain dormant for months when
Belknap took an interest in it. The chief suspect
had been a certain Colonel Blake, a man of great personal
magnetism, strong political associations and
influential friends. The feeling had become current
that he was guilty and that it was being &lsquo;hushed
up,&rsquo; that the law was once more proving inadequate.
But in this instance Belknap was able to give the law
a clean slate. Jumping to insane conclusions in the
intuitive manner that was his strongest claim to
distinction, he put his finger on little Violet Mowbray,
a musical comedy dancer, who had had a last-minute
invitation as an &lsquo;extra&rsquo; for Stanton&rsquo;s party.
Although it was believed that she and Stanton had
thereby met for the first time, Belknap discovered
a weird series of events that put Stanton in the
most blasting light and gave poor Violet a dozen
motives for murder. Violet took her sentence of
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
from ten to twenty years with a quiet protestation
of innocence that moved the courtroom to
tears and hysteria. No one seeing her frail figure
led away that dull December day would have said
she could live to see a year of it served.</p>
<p>Since the weeks when he had kept his name
and face headlined, together with Stanton&rsquo;s and
Violet Mowbray&rsquo;s, Belknap had had several months
of comparative quiet. He had given the police
some assistance in a few minor matters, but had
really fastened his teeth into nothing worth the
candle. And at the moment he felt particularly
in need of violent distraction. He was surfeited
with a week of burning sun; weary of women;
stale with an overdose of detective fiction; and
disturbed by a tendency on the part of his thoughts
to take a gloomier turn than usual.</p>
<p>Yet for some odd reason Whittaker&rsquo;s ring,
following the words of their last meeting, gave him
pause. He knew Whittaker as a dangerous person,
<i>friend</i> or enemy, often even more dangerous as
the former. Their relationship had of late been
strained. Belknap had all but come to the conclusion
that any intercourse between them, kindly or
unkindly, had been dropped. Then why this matter
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
of life and death? Oh well, curiosity had
killed more than cats. He reached for the
receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Oh, Whittaker? Good to hear your
voice.&rdquo; (a little overdone that. Rang false)
&ldquo;Of course, old boy.&rdquo; (Now why was he calling
him &lsquo;old boy&rsquo;?) &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be delighted, more than
delighted.&rdquo; (Good God, I don&rsquo;t even mean delighted)
&ldquo;Something thrilling for me to do?
You&rsquo;re going to put me wise? Oh, I see: give me
an opportunity to <i>get</i> wise. Of course. Any old
thing for a change.... No, I don&rsquo;t exactly catch
your meaning. You&rsquo;re pleasantly mysterious as
usual.&rdquo; (Diabolically so, is what I want to say,
and I will say it one of these days.) &ldquo;A house full
of criminals? Since when have you been on
week-end terms with Sing Sing? They&rsquo;ve never
been in Sing Sing? You want me to help you put
them there, is that it? You bet your sweet life.
Anything to do with what you let fall to my ear
last week? It has? When do you want me?
Dinner tonight. Thanks most awfully. I&rsquo;ll be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up; but failed to return to the Audubon
which lay open on his knees, an original
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Folio, given him with relief and gratitude by
Colonel Blake. Instead he relapsed into a brown
study and considered a rather sinister possibility
from several angles and in varied lights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c2">II</h2>
<p>Belknap made the distance to Whittaker&rsquo;s
Long Island mansion at Blue Acres in something
under an hour. His Dusenberg, long and low-slung,
colored to please his own eye, and fitted with
special gadgets for defence and utility, was also a
demon for speed, and even in traffic had broken
many records, largely its own to be sure. He had
always driven himself, and he had often reflected
that if he had not been a lawyer or a sleuth he
would have been ticking off mileage at Daytona.
Such was his love of the power and beauty of line
of a splendid machine. And he admired as much
as he admired any work of art his brown, thin,
muscular hand on the wheel, one mahogany, the
other coffee.</p>
<p>As he turned into the wide, sweeping drive of
Thorngate, he slowed the car to a crawl, and savored
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
for a moment the view of the Sound, the
lemon and orange sunset beyond it, the peace of
the trees and shrubs and flowers on either side. He
listened with one ear to the swish of the tires in
the traprock gravel roadbed, and with the other
to the cicadas making the mad sound of a semi-an&aelig;sthetized
brain among the oaks.</p>
<p>Black John, alert and loquacious, opened the
door to him, and showed him immediately to a
large, luxurious room on the second floor. Belknap
stood at the long windows, looking down, and
shedding, with the deafness characteristic of his
general indifference, John&rsquo;s flow of well-intentioned
chatter as he unpacked and laid out Belknap&rsquo;s
week-end wardrobe. Belknap was so far
removed from it as to be unaware of John&rsquo;s withdrawal.
Unaware also of Bertrand Whittaker&rsquo;s
entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made the trip in short order, I imagine.
How are you, Belknap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid, thanks. Yes, I came down fast
enough. There is nothing to warrant a leisurely
drive on Long Island&mdash;until after Shinnecock
Hills perhaps. Before that the sooner it&rsquo;s over
the better. You know I am still forever being
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
surprised that there can be such charming and secluded
spots as this within a stone&rsquo;s throw of these
atrocious main highways. And yours is one of the
best, Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> it, Belknap!&rdquo; Whittaker&rsquo;s face lighted
with pleased vanity. But it died on the instant.
&ldquo;I shall hate to leave it. More than I shall hate to
leave anything else, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap paused with their lighted cigarette
match arrested between them, and quickly met
the eyes he had been studiously avoiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave? Why, when, and where for? Going
abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittaker&rsquo;s immediate answer was a cold
smile. He accepted his light and crossed to a
chair. Belknap regarded him intently through
puffs of his own smoke, and being a keen student
of men when he cared to be, or found it necessary,
he remarked a new hardness in the hard grey face.
Whittaker was a grey man: iron-grey hair, granite
skin, grey-blue eyes, gun-metal suits, and plenty
of grey matter. He was a man too able, too willfully
brilliant, for the cramped position in which
he had to work. So he put the extra energy into
deviltry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he is doing now,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
thought Belknap, &ldquo;and God help somebody.
Somehow I think it&rsquo;s God help him for a change.&rdquo;
But he wasn&rsquo;t prepared for being quite as right as
he proved to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly abroad. Though perhaps yes,
in a very broad sense. Sit down, Belknap, and
we&rsquo;ll talk, if you don&rsquo;t mind being serious on an
empty stomach. The drinks will be up shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, man, by all means. You are now
making things sound, not only mysterious, but
rather important. What&rsquo;s it <i>to</i> you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great deal to me, I&rsquo;m afraid. It seems
I have short shrift, Belknap. I&rsquo;m sentenced to
death. The doctors have given me six months&mdash;or
&lsquo;with luck,&rsquo; as they put it, an extra one or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! Why I&rsquo;ve always thought you
one of the fittest. What <i>is</i> wrong? Whittaker,
I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;too terribly sorry. Is there a thing
I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is.&rdquo; A flare of wicked humor
came and went in Whittaker&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll
come to that in a moment. I&rsquo;m dying of cancer.
In a bad spot. I&rsquo;m in for pain and a great deal
of it; more than I can quite bear to put up with, I
guess. &lsquo;Six months to live.&rsquo; It may sound short
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
enough to you, but to me it sounds an eternity.
Six <i>weeks</i>, yes; I might have kept a stiff upper lip
for six weeks. But that&rsquo;s about my limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;it&rsquo;s suicide?&rdquo; Belknap asked, and
did his level best, in respect to the situation, not
to show a fierce impatience that he should have
been asked in at the death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, not strictly speaking. Though I&rsquo;ve
always contended suicide is justifiable in such circumstances.
And I purchased a very pretty little
Colt last week for the purpose. But I reconsidered.
I&rsquo;ve been a man who made himself felt
going and coming; you can testify to that, Belknap.
Then why make this particular exit dull
and unromantic, with nothing more said of it than,
&lsquo;Mr. Bertrand Whittaker had been suffering from
ill health, and it is thought&mdash;etc., etc.&rsquo; You
know the line. So, as I&rsquo;ve said, I didn&rsquo;t shoot.
For here was the perfect opportunity to go the
limit with life and death, nothing to lose that
wouldn&rsquo;t be gain. In other words I could leave a
bit of a pother behind me&mdash;in commemoration.
And, my dear fellow, I&rsquo;ve hit on an idea that I
doubt even you could match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap&rsquo;s face was a mosaic of varying expression:
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
sympathy of a kind, eager curiosity, distrust
and threatening disapprobation. A man of
Whittaker&rsquo;s evil propensities could do considerable
damage if he was driven, as now, to turn at bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think twice, Whittaker,&rdquo; Belknap warned
him quietly, &ldquo;before you mention your idea even
to me. We can drop it here and now. I promise
to ask no questions. Remember a doctor&rsquo;s judgement
has been as often reversed as a judge&rsquo;s!
Don&rsquo;t be rash under the first shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being rash. This is a certainty, born
witness to by my flesh and bones. The doctors
didn&rsquo;t surprise me, to tell you the truth. But I
had rather banked on being tabled, so to speak, and
dying under the knife. No such luck. So it&rsquo;s my
six months or my week-end, and I&rsquo;m going to make
it the week-end. If that fails me I can always fall
back on the pistol. Putting two and two together,
do you begin to get my drift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do in the least. I suppose I&rsquo;m
stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a detective I think you are. Well, to
call a spade a spade, I intend to be murdered&mdash;with
you in attendance to get the murderer. Is
that clear enough?&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Belknap, without the flicker of an eye-lash,
darkly concentrated on a point somewhere between
himself and the ceiling. Whittaker examined
him secretly and furtively from under overhanging
brows. The atmosphere had a tendency
to thicken before Belknap drew himself back to
the necessities of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks most awfully,&rdquo; he said with a hard,
ironic twist of the lips, &ldquo;for this amazing opportunity.
It quite takes my breath away. Undoubtedly
I should make a drastic effort to turn
your intention, as one is expected to withhold a
man about to leap from the Brooklyn Bridge. But
I admit I&rsquo;m frankly curious as to details. So before
I seize you around the neck, metaphorically
speaking, let&rsquo;s hear more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittaker&rsquo;s body, from a slight stiffening,
yielded to the shape of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted that your first reaction <i>is</i> curiosity,
Belknap; for in that case I feel sure I
can eventually enlist your interest in the bizarre
and dramatic elements of the situation. I feared
you&rsquo;d mount the pulpit, or the bench, or the stand
of mere friendship, deliver me a moral lecture, and
ring up your pet specialist for an appointment.
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
In which event,&rdquo; he added with faint mockery, &ldquo;I
should have resorted to your rival, Silas Berry. So
you see I <i>am</i> determined. And so far so good. I
swear it&rsquo;s been good fun making arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing, putting in what I call
my supply of ammunition. Although I have a
fair handful of erstwhile, and therefore potential,
murderers on my visiting list, it was another matter
to bring enough of the right sort together to insure
a pleasant week-end, and a week-end that, as you
can see for yourself, may be indefinitely prolonged&mdash;for
<i>them</i>! Several of my favorite respectable
killers are in foreign parts. But I&rsquo;ve managed at
least eight. Do you want a brief synopsis? Of
course certain of them are familiar to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap tried matching casualness with casualness.
He leaned over and lit a table lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I enquire how many of them are in the
house? And how soon we may expect action?
There may easily be a brace of us, Whittaker, before
we&rsquo;re through. A more or less famous detective
left floating around on the scene of the crime
might be considered rather a serious handicap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that moment John, entering with a tray,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
was responsible for the startled movement of both
men. Whittaker remarked on it as he poured
them each a highball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently certain death hasn&rsquo;t yet quenched
my instinct of self-preservation. Naturally one
can&rsquo;t destroy in a week fifty years of vital energy
and will to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, old timer, are you sure even now that
this is the best way out for you? What about repentance
and the Church? Go in for it thoroughly,
I mean, and try for the Heavenly Choir.
You&rsquo;re too good a tenor to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittaker laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too good a devil to waste, Belknap. Better
devil than tenor I think. No, I&rsquo;m going out in a
sputter of fire and brimstone&mdash;no candles for me....
Aha! I hear someone arriving. Possibly
Blake. He was motoring in from Southampton.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c3">III</h2>
<p>Standing at the windows, Belknap looking
over Whittaker&rsquo;s shoulder, they saw Blake spring
lightly from the seat of his Ford convertible, throw
out his bags from the rumble, spring back, and
&ldquo;zoom&rdquo; around the corner to the garage.</p>
<p>Putting a hand on Whittaker&rsquo;s arm, Belknap
brought him roughly about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ring Blake in on this?&rdquo; he asked, and his
voice took a deadly level. His lips also leveled to
a straight line, and his teeth showed white in the
slit between. &ldquo;After all he&rsquo;s <i>too</i> good a friend,
isn&rsquo;t he, of yours, <i>and</i> mine? What&rsquo;s the big
idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> a friend, old man, true enough.&rdquo; Whittaker
quietly brushed Belknap&rsquo;s hand from his
sleeve, and turned away. &ldquo;But what are friends,
true or false, to me now? &lsquo;Less than the dust.&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Besides, Blake is a crack shot&mdash;and a sportsman
to boot. Even though you proved so brilliantly
that he didn&rsquo;t shoot Stanton, it was just the kind
of shooting he might have done, you know that.
He gives no quarter to men who run out on debts,
or dishonor women. Sort of a knight errant&mdash;goes
about saving situations in the nick of time.
That he finds it convenient to use a gun in most
cases is not <i>his</i> fault. I can even see him doing
me what he would call &lsquo;a good turn,&rsquo; taking me
out after a whiskey and soda, and putting a hole
through me against the garden wall with a Sorrell-and-Son
generosity, &lsquo;We mustn&rsquo;t let the poor devil
suffer.&rsquo; Yes, Belknap, you must admit he&rsquo;s a
splendid prospect from my point of view. I can&rsquo;t
help it that you have scruples against sleuthing
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s holy, you are beyond me, Whittaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean by that that I am beyond the pale,
I am. And beyond caring. There may or may
not be a life in death, but that there is death in life
I&rsquo;m finding out. So what the Hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough said, Whittaker. We&rsquo;ll leave it at that.
I begin to see that it <i>is</i> &lsquo;what the Hell&rsquo; and then
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
some.&rdquo; Belknap was pacing the floor, his hands
thrust deep in his pockets. He stopped before
Whittaker to ask, &ldquo;I have a question before we go
further. What&rsquo;s the match, that lights the fuse,
that blows up the house that Bertrand built?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good match, Ordway, soaked in tar, pitch, and
turpentine. I publish my Diary. It&rsquo;s a substantial,
well-filled, truthful Diary, packed with sensations.
In a period when confessions and revelations
are in such demand, it seemed a pity not to keep
abreast of the times. Hearst gives me a small fortune
for mine, sight unseen, and it goes, in my will,
with whatever else I possess, to my niece Joel&mdash;unless,
of course, this week-end makes it useless to
her; in which case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joel Lacey! See here, Whittaker, you&rsquo;re insane!
I&rsquo;ve cared for Joel, and you know it, since
she was too young to know the meaning of the
word love. She is incapable of murder. But if
she <i>had</i> committed a crime, and you were letting
her down, you would have me to reckon with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear! The first threat, and that from
my bodyguard. Check it for Berry&rsquo;s benefit. It
happens, my dear fellow, that your estimate of
Joel&rsquo;s character, like that of all true lovers, is mistaken.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Joel is a murderess. Her husband wasn&rsquo;t
a suicide. Oh, she had incentive enough, I guess.
And it was hardly a murder in one sense: she challenged
him to a duel but he scoffed at the very idea.
So she fired anyway, and came to me to give herself
up. I silenced her. As for letting her in for
all this&mdash;well, I needed her. I was short of women
for the dinner table. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
bothered with her, for my hopes don&rsquo;t lean very
heavily on her, I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought you <i>might</i> be short of
women. Who are the others, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romany Monte Video for one. The accident
in <i>The Renegade Lover</i>, in which she killed her
husband (who was not her husband in private)
with a folding dagger which didn&rsquo;t collapse was
not an accident. The dagger that night was not
intended to fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertrand, you&rsquo;re a cad. When did you desert
Romany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years ago. I didn&rsquo;t desert her. She left me
for&mdash; Oh, I can&rsquo;t even remember, there have
been so many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no excuse for such betrayal as this. Who
else?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nadia Mdevani. You&rsquo;ve met her here once or
twice, I think; and of course know of her in a
professional way. Not that there has ever been
anything proved against her, quite the contrary,
and yet where there has been a political murder,
here or abroad, during the past ten years, she has
almost invariably been questioned. I should say
offhand that she is probably the tool of a powerful
international ring of Governmental murderers.
But her social distinction is unquestioned, her culture
and wit are superlative, and her beauty is a
thing to be dreamed of. I can say to you now,
what I would not have said under any other circumstances,
that she and I have been&mdash;call it
friends, yet I have not breathed a word to her of
what I instinctively know to be true: that she is a
murderer twenty times over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap shrugged to cover a strong, irrepressible
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a braver man than I am, Gunga Din.
But then, in a pinch, I&rsquo;ve always known you were.
Is that the toll of women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one other. She is not a murderess, but
she is a potential one, for I think she knows that
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
her husband killed a man years ago. Until lately,
when, I am sorry to say, Romany has been having
her innings with him, Neil and Sydney Crawford
were hand and glove in a marriage that I liked to
call a marriage. He is a banker;&mdash;lives out here
at Blue Acres; respected, indeed loved, by everyone
who knows him; and the same can be said of
Sydney. He got inadvertently mixed up with a
gang of boys on the streets of New York, when he
was a youngster, and they later proved to be a
gang in good earnest. So when Crawford was sowing
his wild oats, and had run up a card debt far
beyond anything he knew his father could pay, he
accepted an honorarium for cutting short the career
of a drug smuggler. It was his wildest oat. He
turned over to a very clean leaf; but I think he
would go to any lengths now to save his name for
Sydney and the children. And she would do the
same by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid! Go on. This is too good to be
true. It is really such a sweet reversal of form&mdash;expecting
the bad eggs to hatch. Isn&rsquo;t that Julian
Prentice out there with Joel? Who did <i>he</i> kill&mdash;his
crippled grandmother or something?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad as that&mdash;or I wouldn&rsquo;t have let
him engage himself to Joel. No, he merely
drowned a boy who was all but drowning him
during the hazing of freshmen at the University.
He pretended cramp to do it. Everything appeared
accidental, and of course sympathy was
with Julian anyway. There is one other, who
makes the fourth man&mdash;irrespective of ourselves,
and we don&rsquo;t count. Milton Dorn I doubt
whether you know. He is an able surgeon; but
he also has a secret laboratory, or operating room,
where he experiments on the conscious flesh to the
point, but not beyond the point, where life still
lingers. I should imagine that would be all you
need know about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely! My only wonder is that you
didn&rsquo;t apply directly to him for release.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that. But then, as I&rsquo;ve said, it&rsquo;s
a long row he hoes and I&rsquo;m looking for a short one.
There, Belknap, I guess that tells the tale in brief,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not altogether, Judge. There is a point on
which I need to be enlightened, with a bright,
bright light. Where do I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I had made that clear. You are here
to find good sport, but to be a spoil-sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that, Whittaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the Diary&mdash;why, man alive, it
makes something like a hero of you. My admiration
is written all over it. Perhaps it shouldn&rsquo;t be.
<i>Have</i> you committed murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the time to admit it
exactly, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence fell between them. Belknap broke it
with another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you spring it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I might bring it up at dinner. Unobtrusively.
Casualness will at first bewilder them.
The horror of the situation will dawn on them
gradually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anyone an inkling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one. Except perhaps Nadia. I mentioned
to her the other day that it would be fun to publish
my Diary verbatim seeing what a number of things
it contains. Her answer was, that if I proposed
doing so I would probably never live to see it in
print. That sounds hopeful. Oh, of course nothing
at all may happen. They may decide to take
their medicine for the old rather than be on with
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
the new. I think that would be my solution provided
I was in their shoes. And then again anything
may happen. Psychologically it&rsquo;s a pretty
how-de-do. To throw half a dozen killers together,
even civilized ones (in fact the more civilized
the more interesting), makes for a strange
medley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger than you know, I&rsquo;m afraid. There is
an interrelation of secret currents between your
protagonists that is likely to be devastating. You
may not even be the only casualty. What about
the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call them in at the drop of the hat of course.
The Homicide Department would be delighted to
send Berry along to help you if you suggested it,
I&rsquo;m sure. Well&mdash;what about dressing for dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me.&rdquo; Belknap put a hand on Whittaker&rsquo;s
shoulder as they parted at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whittaker,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what to say exactly. I&rsquo;ll have to reserve my judgement
until later. But again let me say I sincerely
regret the circumstances that have brought us to
the present precarious position. For even I can&rsquo;t
see my way to withdrawing now. I can&rsquo;t forego
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the chance of so much excitement, if nothing else,&rdquo;
he added, with the flicker of a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thought</i> ye couldn&rsquo;t, boy.&rdquo; Whittaker stressed
the shrewd, cunning accents of his Yankee ancestors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV</h2>
<p>The luxurious ease, and quiet, well-oiled machinery
of service at Thorngate gave no slightest
indication of the worm at its heart. Up the long,
winding, carpeted stairs the servants glided on their
errands, and, in turn, the guests themselves came
softly down by ones and twos, with a gleam of
jewels, of colored silk, of white shirt-fronts in the
halls dimly lit with candles.</p>
<p>Belknap had hastened his dressing in order to
be first in the drawing-room. He felt that at any
moment he might be needed in the front line, and
that no time should be wasted under a shower or
before a mirror. His trust in Whittaker was not
so perfect as to assure him that he had been honest
in saying no one was in the least aware of impending
trouble. And there was just the chance that
someone, being forehanded, would get away with
murder!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Although he had been in the receiving room,
which was also library and den, fifty times over,
Belknap looked it over with awakened interest.
Whittaker, it was apparent, had a leaning toward
panelings and oil portraits, medieval tapestries and
deep-napped carpets. Here tapestries formed the
wall covering from floor to ceiling: none of exceptional
value except the Gobelin over the mantel,
but all equally lovely in colors and texture. An
impulse, not so odd perhaps under the circumstances,
prompted Belknap to test what lay immediately
behind the surface of woven cloth and, as
far as its stretching would yield to his hand, he
found space. He tried it at various points and discovered
it everywhere the same; and he recalled
having heard that it was the safest way to hang
tapestries against the rear attack of insects and
dampness. Convenient to know, he thought. He
was engaged in trying to locate the servants&rsquo; entrance
to this interstitial passage when he became
gradually aware that someone else had come into
the room.</p>
<p>He turned about with elaborate sang-froid and
met the gaze of a tall, strikingly handsome woman,
who stood quizzically regarding him. She wore a
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
black sheath gown with crimson accessories that included
the oval nails of tapering fingers and the
clear-cut lips of a willful mouth. The crimson
handkerchief tied to her garnet bracelets floated
lightly up and back at every slightest movement
of her arm. The cigarette case of scarlet enamel
which she opened with a deft flick of one hand to
help herself with the other, gleamed like smoldering
coal.</p>
<p>He had met Nadia Mdevani several times with
Whittaker; and he had vaguely realized the relationship
between them, but had given it little consideration;
except that once he had instinctively
withdrawn from a case in which her name had
figured more or less conspicuously. The sense of
her guilt had been conveyed to him on the wings
of one of what he called his wild guesses, and he
paid Whittaker the courtesy of letting well enough
alone. As it happened, she had cleared herself
easily.</p>
<p>Looking at her now he realized that she was
inwardly disturbed at sight of him. Perhaps she
saw in his mere presence a confirmation of the faint
doubts she might be entertaining with respect to
the week-end. But her poise held perfectly&mdash;in
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
fact it was by a shade of its over-emphasis that he
caught the inner tremor at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Belknap!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in her
slow, husky contralto. &ldquo;How ni-ice to see you
here. Or should I call you Judge Belknap&mdash;or
Detective Ordway Belknap? I am never sure of
the term to your face. Behind your back I call
you Belknap for short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s discard them, all four, and make it simply
Ordway, to my face, as you put it, <i>and</i> behind
my back. And may I make it Nadia? Remember
Bertrand is an equally dear friend to us both.
You are looking divinely, Miss Nadia. Black is
your color. Although I have seen you when I
should have said the same of red, or white for the
matter of that. Red and white are your contrasts.
Tonight you are fused into a single vivid figure of
black. Whistler would have liked you. You have
a way, which most women have not, of lending
distinction to a color instead of letting it create
you. You have a like faculty with situations I am
told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite certain what you may mean
by that, or whether it should entirely please me.
But I have sufficient vanity to be flattered by your
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
recollection of my gowns in view of how little
attention you seemed to give them. Will you have
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She proffered her exquisite box and on his
&ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; crossed to the hearth where she
lifted a crimson-slippered foot to the side bar of the
fender, and for graceful balance (pose, Belknap
thought it) laid a hand against the tapestried wall.
It yielded enough to mar her picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten these tapestries are but the
semblance of walls,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;What a cosy
place for rats. Although I suppose it was for the
very purpose of perpetrating the Hamlet act against
rats that the space was originally reserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap was pouring himself a thimbleful of
Scotch at the tray standing in readiness on the divan
table. He tossed it off, and turned over the after
flavor on his tongue, as his mind turned over the
possible subtleties of Nadia&rsquo;s remark. She had
made it piquant by a twist of inflection. A Polonius
as well as a rat&mdash;or so the tone implied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were speaking of Bertrand,&rdquo; she continued
abruptly. &ldquo;Do you not consider him a little secretive
about the week-end, conveying that there is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
<i>reason</i> why we are here? Why should there need
be a reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>should</i> be none, Nadia, except our enjoyment
of his unbounded hospitality. But I feel
myself, now that you mention it,&rdquo; Belknap pursued,
willing to test where her guards were raised,
&ldquo;that Bertrand has something up his sleeve. Possibly
an announcement; he likes to make any news
impressive. He may have lost his shirt in the Market,
or been left a fortune by his great-aunt Emma
in Vermont. You know Bertrand well enough to
know he&rsquo;d celebrate either with equal pomp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard the little whispering sigh that Nadia
suddenly drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s nothing serious,&rdquo; she said, more to
herself than Belknap. Then, quickly: &ldquo;Is it the
Diary?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Belknap hesitated by the fraction of a second.
By all accounts Nadia Mdevani was dangerous.
Her intelligence, fearlessness and beauty were things
that might throw dust in any man&rsquo;s eyes. Her
ability to &lsquo;clinch,&rsquo; as she was doing now, with a
power greater than her own, and cut her way free
from within, had won her many a hand-to-hand
encounter that if taken blow for blow would have
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
seen her downed long ago. However, Belknap
could see no better way at the moment than to close
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the Diary,&rdquo; he said quietly; and
stood spellbound by the extreme beauty of her face
as the color mounted under the ivory skin, accentuating
the high, molded contours of the bones beneath
it. He could not have said whether she were
more angered or hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; Her low voice held its ground;
not by a shade did it show disquiet. &ldquo;How much
time is granted us to deal with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was smitten with admiration at the serenity
and ease of her apparent candor. With veteran
coolness she took him on. He could do no less
than to match her play for play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He intends letting the cat out of the bag tonight.
But there will be nothing published for
several days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I don&rsquo;t know why, Mr. Detective,
you are being so kind and telling me tales out
of school.&rdquo; She turned fully toward him and gave
him one of her rare smiles, lifting her drooped eyelids
enough to show two burning high-lights, like
two stars under an edge of cloud. &ldquo;I had to know
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
how swift the sands were running away. Even
you can&rsquo;t speed them or retard them. And you
wouldn&rsquo;t if you could&mdash;for you have really seen
me tonight for the first time,&rdquo; she said, with the
faint irony he was beginning to adore because in a
more subtle and whimsical way, it counterbalanced
his own. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; She took a flower from a
bowl on the table and broke it short for his buttonhole.
At that moment he had regretfully to turn
from her. Whittaker, at his elbow, was presenting
the Crawfords.</p>

</table>
<p>was the way they sat at dinner.</p>
<p>Belknap regretted Miss Video on his left. He
was one of the few who had never been properly
infatuated with the Romany patteran, as he privately
named her for her continuous flow of inconsequential
chatter, and had therefore never liked
her. It was one thing or the other with Romany.
She was a sylph-like creature with enormous eyes,
an auburn Viennese bob, and a disingenuous manner.
She &lsquo;needed&rsquo; them, was the way men put it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
first their friendship, then their protection, finally
their passion. You couldn&rsquo;t somehow let her down
by disappointing her. They said she was weak and
easily swayed, and each in turn flattered himself
he could strengthen her philosophy against a bitter
world (a world he helped to embitter, if he could
but see it that way), and help her get on her feet.
Yet somehow she had never mastered this art of
walking alone!</p>
<p>Belknap, always irritated by willowy natures,
now wished her in Kingdom Come. He wanted to
renew the dangerous but charming intimacies that
had swiftly and strangely sprung up between himself
and Nadia Mdevani; and here would have been
his opportunity, with Nadia beside him sending odd
disturbing currents up the arm that almost brushed
hers. He felt her mind being restive and wild,
puzzled and angry, and above all keenly intent on
a loophole of escape. If anyone else should succeed
in silencing Whittaker forever it would not
be because Nadia had yielded her designs but because
she had delayed long enough to be cunning
and intricate in their workmanship. She even
seemed, now that the die was cast, rather to relish
the added risk of having Belknap in the arena with
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
her. Whittaker, asked for a description of Nadia,
would have said the obvious things about raven
locks and snowdrift skin, with eyes too revealing
to go revealed. Belknap, after this evening, would
have spoken of her in terms of a banked fire with
a scent of brimstone. With less than half his exasperated
attention given to Romany&rsquo;s innumerable
reasons, centering in jealousy, why she had not
been assigned to lead in <i>After Midnight</i>, he
glanced surreptitiously at Nadia. Her face, ivory
white and immobile, signified nothing. He wondered
whether he might be mistaken in thinking
the atmosphere so heavily charged between them.
His appraising eye passed down the table, appreciating
beauty and distinction where he found it, and
paused at Joel&mdash;dear Joel, not beautiful perhaps,
but dear looking. Belknap, in his fashion, had
loved her; but for his own bachelor&rsquo;s sake (he was
not an unselfish man), as well as for her youth&rsquo;s
sake, he had never spoken of it to her. Looking
unwaveringly ahead into a night that might well
be terrible for them all, he felt a particular pang
for her. She was talking <i>sotto voce</i> with Julian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, dear, people are listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then darling, more darling, most darling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, <i>please</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see your amber eyes, not the back
of a leaf-brown head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say things like that at the table. Speak
when you are spoken to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you say something nice to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked around at him, half tearful, half
laughing, under her lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dearest one, is it as bad as all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse, Joel, much worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course it must be a dream, and a very bad
one, that Whittaker had been saying things about
cancer and murder and murderers. The more so
when one looked at Whittaker himself, sitting genially,
though perhaps with an extra dash of grey
pallor, at the head of his board, lifting his champagne
to touch glasses with Sydney Crawford: &ldquo;To
the lips, to the eyes.&rdquo; The Stein song again!
Would its revival never die? Yet it quite applied
at Whittaker&rsquo;s table tonight. Every woman in her
way was as fair, as vital, as more than willing to
play up, as any man could ask. Even Sydney,
with a flash of challenging laughter at her husband,
was returning Hartley Blake&rsquo;s sallies in kind. Sydney
was obviously fey tonight, with a heightened
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
color, brighter eyes, and a recklessness of sentiment
that might mean trouble. Had Neil and Romany
failed in discretion?</p>
<p>Blake was in his usual excellent form; and it
was plain to see thought his wit of too good a flavor
to be entirely spent on a woman, even the excited
Sydney. So he was tossing it by means of a slightly
lifted voice up over his right shoulder at Dorn.
Dorn however looked darkly unresponsive, and, being
a man of few words, it seemed probable Blake
would never know whether his delightful flippancies
and exaggerations were being appreciated.
Then, suddenly, he knew:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for myself,&rdquo; Dorn remarked to his side-partners
in particular, and to the table tangentially,
&ldquo;I have recently resolved to remain silent unless I
feel that I can definitely contribute something
worth while to the conversation. Time and energy
are indiscriminately wasted in the futile, the repetitive,
and the platitudinous. If we could hold our
tongues until they were loosed by the real idea, the
absolute necessity of speech, there would at least be
a deal less noise, and quite possibly a return to the
art of thinking which at present is a lost one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an insulting and uncalled for remark
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
under the circumstances. Romany, who looked
positively crestfallen for a change, perhaps needed
a blunt rebuke (she wasn&rsquo;t suppressed in a day),
but Blake, though an inveterate talker, was a brilliant
one. His high color showed such anger that
the control of his first words was surprising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not only hold it, Dorn, I should bite
it if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence that fell in the room was deep and
ominous. But in it was Whittaker&rsquo;s opportunity,
not only to distract Dorn and Blake, but to call
attention to himself. Here, like Jason, he could
cast his stone among the dragon&rsquo;s teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I <i>have</i> a contribution to make to the
conversation, to the evening&rsquo;s pastime, and I hope
to posterity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap, without looking her way, knew that
Nadia stiffened and straightened at the words. As
for the others, their eyes turned to Whittaker expectantly,
but with no premonitory awakening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had planned letting you learn of what I intend
when it had ceased to be an intention and become
an actuality. In other words, you were only
to know of the publication of my memoirs when
you saw them in print. But I really can&rsquo;t resist a
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
little boasting in advance, and I thought I might
read scraps of them after dinner to the assembled
gathering, before we get down to bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how wonderful of you, Uncle Bertrand,&rdquo;
Joel exclaimed, eager to help him, as she thought,
tide over the embarrassing moment. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you were writing. You have so many irons
in the fire, how <i>did</i> you find time to do a book?
But it must have been pretty good fun, so much
has happened to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t recent, Joel; it&rsquo;s been written at odd
moments over a period of twenty years. In other
words, it&rsquo;s my Diary. But it <i>is</i> packed full of
material, and all sorts of things. Everybody&rsquo;s in
it. Oh yes, you are all there, my dears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like Red Riding Hood&rsquo;s wolf, Bertrand,&rdquo;
Nadia said with cold acidity, and at her
tone the first chill, like the first autumn frost, fell
on them all. &ldquo;Just what do you mean when you
say we are in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that, Nadia darling. I hope you are in
it to the life, as I&rsquo;m sure I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it is a character portrayal of your
friends and foes as well as a revelation of your own
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
nature&mdash;you sinner,&rdquo; she added with bitter lightness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You express it in a nutshell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what right does one betray one&rsquo;s friends&mdash;even
in the cause of literature; and you will excuse
me, Whittaker, if I doubt the literary merits
of your pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the modern right of giving the public what
it craves and pays for: the revelation of evil, the
worse the merrier. It used to be how I found the
true light; now it is how I went plumb to Hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you did perhaps, but not how I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In most instances one touches close upon the
other, I&rsquo;m afraid. It is a platitude of course (I
ask your pardon, Dorn) to remark that we none
of us can sin alone, but it is true nevertheless.
Even the person that hears the tale of a crime is
somehow affected. I feel the need of clearing my
decks, of things heard and committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it would earn you a free pass through
the pearly gates, supposing your proposed act comes
off. Mark I say proposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your glove, Blake? You must be able
to get gloves at a discount.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;My glove, yes, but not concealing the dagger
beneath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you where and when you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Ordway Belknap as your second, I suppose?
No, thank you; there are safer ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make it fast, man,&rdquo; Whittaker cried in
a suddenly broken voice as the dew of intense pain
stood out on his forehead and he drooped a little
forward over the table. &ldquo;The time is short for
both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Mr. Belknap,&rdquo; Nadia exclaimed, &ldquo;Romany
is fainting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It <i>would</i> be Romany who took things the hardest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c6">VI</h2>
<p>Half an hour later found the atmosphere of the
library anything but comfortable&mdash;indeed strained
almost to the breaking point. Whittaker&rsquo;s slow
poison was beginning to take effect. Ignoring the
ominous rolling up of clouds, he had quietly but
firmly gone ahead with the plan to read aloud a
few pages of the Diary. With malicious casualness
he had suggested the withdrawal of anyone
who felt more in the mood for billiards or bridge:
&ldquo;You know the billiard room, Blake. Do get up
a game if it suits you. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly
thrilling about an old man mumbling over his
memories of other days. I merely thought one or
two of you might prefer a moment&rsquo;s pause in the
day&rsquo;s occupation that I could beguile, even if I put
you asleep.&rdquo; But, aside from Dorn who had excused
himself directly after dinner with, &ldquo;Doctors,
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
you know, Whittaker. Frightfully sorry. I&rsquo;ll try
to get back tomorrow,&rdquo; there was not one that had
had the strength to keep away from the spider&rsquo;s
parlor. Though for a moment it had appeared
that Belknap might follow Dorn&rsquo;s example: &ldquo;Come
now, don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re off, too?&rdquo; Whittaker&rsquo;s
tone half-mocked, half-threatened him as he stood
indecisively in the hall toying with the door-latch.
&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Belknap had answered with impatient
asperity. &ldquo;Hardly that! I have a small contribution
to make to the evening&rsquo;s pleasure. It&rsquo;s in
the car. I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo; He was, in a jiffy, with
several bottles of what he said was &rsquo;11 champagne,
and which, as Whittaker knew, came from one of
the finest cellars in New York.</p>
<p>But no one else turned even an attentive eye to
the gift which Belknap was arranging with exaggerated
care on the tray of crystal-bright decanters
and dark-bright bottles. Curiosity, dread, and
sheer hypnotism, combined to magnetize them into
a rigid ensemble about Whittaker&rsquo;s reading lamp.
But it was a brittle, surface rigidity&mdash;like the first
thin ice formed over moving water. Beneath it
the twisting, roiling currents of agonized apprehension
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
wore through and disturbed the dangerous stillness
of the room. Nadia Mdevani&rsquo;s puffs at her
cigarette were too brief, and she flicked unformed
ash too often. Blake in the corner ferociously over-shuffled
a pack of cards. At the piano Romany&rsquo;s
fingers lacked control, and the snatches of song she
attempted lost themselves in broken pitch. But she
had at least recovered from her faintness, which she
had apologetically laid to a week&rsquo;s indulgence in late
hours, and to cocktails for tea at Sands Point.
Crawford was turning the leaves of <i>The Sportsman</i>,
but with such erratic rapidity that he must
have been unaware of what he saw. Only Julian
and Joel, looking worlds at each other, plus suns
and moons and stars, still seemed a little stupidly
blind to what was happening.</p>
<p>As Whittaker arranged his stage setting&mdash;chair
and lamp just so, and a pillow at his back&mdash;the
ritual of after-dinner coffee proceeded with its
usual calm and efficiency. A robot maid, pretty
and slim-figured in black and white, brought the
service, and John passed the cups. He then quietly
opened the windows of the terrace to the warm
May night, asked his master was there anything
further, and retired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Whittaker cleared his throat; and the sound startled
the room as thoroughly as though it had been
a shot. It drew the line at conversation and movement.
Across the stillness Whittaker&rsquo;s first words
assumed an enlarged importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve told you, this is a day to day record of
my life for the past twelve or fifteen years.&rdquo; By a
motion of his hand he indicated to them a thick,
flexible, thin-paper notebook, bound in tooled
su&egrave;de. &ldquo;Tonight I am taking a leaf from a day
two years ago, June 19, 1929. I recall the day
vividly; and I can quite imagine that Markham
does. (We&rsquo;ll say Markham&mdash;the real name
needn&rsquo;t figure until we go into print.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Markham called me early this evening to say
he must see me immediately. I was engaged for a
theatre party, and did not wish to disappoint my
hostess, but Markham was obstinate and I yielded.
He lives only a matter of minutes from Thorngate.
When he appeared it was more than obvious that
something was wrong. He was pale, his eyes bloodshot,
and his voice somewhere in his shoes. It seems
he is being blackmailed on two counts, an old one
and a new one; the new one being a mistress, and
therefore dangerous to his family; the old one being
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
a strange case of murder, and therefore more dangerous
to himself. It is the murder that I consider
worth recounting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Markham is the son, only son, of old Markham
who once broke the bank at Monte Carlo. There
is wildness in the family. The boy grew up higgledy-piggledy
in a part of New York that was
rapidly changing from good to bad and bad to
worse. Watched with less than half an eye by a
succession of uninvestigated nurses and governesses,
when they could be afforded at all, Markham naturally
and easily became a member of a boy&rsquo;s gang in
the block; and this gang of children grew up
to be the real thing. He was not able to break
with them, even if he had cared to do so. They
bled his father by way of him. They led him by
gradual stages into mischief, into badness and into
sin. The day came when, owing one too many
grand to some card racketeers working the steamship
lines to Havana, he was ready to accept payment
for murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A jet-black night in midwinter found him entering
an apparently abandoned shack in a lonely
curve of the Hackensack on the barren flats outside
Newark. Nothing for miles but snow-drifted
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
meadows and a black river turgidly rolling seaward.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A style worthy of the American Institute,&rdquo;
Julian murmured to Joel, &ldquo;where vocabulary
counts&mdash;I mean wordiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Julian! Your uncle&rsquo;s a member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The single room, into which Markham crept
upward by way of a loose floor board, reeked of
stale tobacco smoke, soiled clothes, and an odd sweet
odor that he had long ago learned to recognize as
opium. Knife in hand, he settled against the wall
near the locked door to await his victim&rsquo;s home-coming.
There were mice about. He identified
mice. And a branch blowing against the window-pane.
That was easy. But there was another
sound, persistent and regular&mdash;like, like breathing.
Breathing! Good God, it <i>was</i> breathing. The
smuggler wasn&rsquo;t abroad smuggling, according to
plan. The cold sweat broke out on Markham&rsquo;s
palms and forehead. Were they each crouching in
the dark waiting the other&rsquo;s move? The next
scuttle of a mouse shattered his flesh and bones like
a blow. He was goose-flesh from head to foot,
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
including his scalp which pained him with its effort
to lift his hair.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see he thought his goose was cooked,&rdquo; was
Julian&rsquo;s next aside to Joel. Something was at last
beginning to take place in Julian. Belknap saw a
little sleepy devil waking in him that might not
always prove easy to deal with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The man on the bed moved; lay still; shifted
again. There was nothing for it but to strike.
He sprang and struck: and drove the little knife
up to his hand in something soft. He was saying
tonight that a knife murder is not so good for the
murderer whatever it may be to the murdered.
He says the physical sensations will last him for life:
the scraping of the blade on a bone, its spongy
sinking home in a vital part, the sudden sagging of
the body under one&rsquo;s own tensity, and the last gasping
gurgling breath against the face. Markham
had never seen this man&rsquo;s face, never would see it;
but he would remember the feeling of the unshaven
chin and the small, fat body; and the smell of
sweated clothes mingling with the warm smell of
fresh blood&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, Whittaker,&rdquo; Crawford said
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
in an inhuman voice, &ldquo;I should like a glass of water.
May I ring?&rdquo; He tried to rise, staggered, and said,
&ldquo;Help me, Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed that Sydney had not heard him or was
unable to move. She didn&rsquo;t stir, or move her eyes.
But Romany, from a huddled, shivering figure on
the divan, came to life and ran to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Durian, Neil, my beloved, my only love.
What is he doing to you? I can&rsquo;t bear it. I
won&rsquo;t let him do things like this&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
care&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romany didn&rsquo;t finish&mdash;Sydney had heard, and
had struck Romany a blow that threw her against
the table. Nadia was laughing terribly as Blake
came across toward Whittaker with murder on his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now by all that&rsquo;s holy or unholy, you have
overstepped the bounds, Bertrand Whittaker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether he ever reached Whittaker remained in
doubt for at that moment the room was plunged
in total darkness. Someone screamed&mdash;a woman.
There was a scuffle and a thud. A man groaned.
Belknap cried out: &ldquo;Stay where you are as you
value your lives.&rdquo; They heard him feeling the wall
for the switch, and then there was light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>In it Whittaker lay back half conscious in his
chair, bleeding at the forehead. The others stood
in oddly arrested positions like the players of ten-step
on the count of ten. And the Diary was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c7">VII</h2>
<p>As a ditch drains at the opening of a sluice,
leaves and twigs sucked one by one, slow at first
then rapidly, down the outward current, the
library drained of guests, silently, furtively, slow
almost to the door, swift as the need to escape the
room, the others, and their own astounding collapse
under sudden stress, dragged them away.
When the last of them had disappeared, Belknap,
with John&rsquo;s aid, helped Bertrand Whittaker to his
room. They paused at his threshold. For the
moment there seemed nothing to say. Both perhaps
felt the effects of a certain, for them, anti-climax
to the evening&rsquo;s events&mdash;something rather
hollow, almost something ridiculous, in the situation.
Whittaker felt let down. Belknap ugly
and impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the head?&rdquo; Belknap asked stiffly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite all right, thanks,&rdquo; Whittaker answered
with equal stiffness. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not now. There&rsquo;s too much in the affrighted
air. Get some sleep if you can. Though
perhaps you think you&rsquo;ll get plenty of that soon
enough. Well, you&rsquo;ve started the ball rolling
with a vengeance, haven&rsquo;t you? Satisfied? God,
Whittaker, hadn&rsquo;t you better cry quits? It isn&rsquo;t
too late. Tell &rsquo;em it was a practical joke; and ask
Crawford&rsquo;s pardon on the side. You see for yourself
it isn&rsquo;t going to be so daisy simple. <i>A</i> murder!
We&rsquo;ll be lucky if it&rsquo;s only half a dozen.
There was no lovelight in any one&rsquo;s eyes this evening,
except in that poor little goose of a Joel&rsquo;s.
And she went upstairs looking withered. Slice
this house from garret to cellar right now and it
would make as pretty a Desire Under the Elms
cross-section as you could find in a day&rsquo;s journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The desire being to get me, huh?&rdquo; Whittaker
asked grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. If only whoever gets you would just
please make a thorough job of it. Who do you
think tried it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t a ghost; have you? Thought it was
going to be the Colonel somehow. But the blow
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
didn&rsquo;t quite come from his direction. Still, he
may have swung around me in the dark. It was
a nasty knock, I think with metal, but glancing.
That&rsquo;s what saved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whittaker, you <i>are</i> a cool one. Wish I could
match you tonight. But there are moments when
I don&rsquo;t like it. Change your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Never!</i> No, as I said before, if you don&rsquo;t
like the game, get out. I&rsquo;ll find a detective to
whom it <i>will</i> be a challenge to the best work that&rsquo;s
in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>I</i> will never get out. You know that;
you know it only too well, you old reprobate.
Filthy as the weather looks ahead, catch me refusing
to go through it, if it&rsquo;s there to go through.
Well, while we linger here the plot undoubtedly
thickens. I&rsquo;d best get a move-on. Good-by&mdash;for
the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, and good-hunting,&rdquo; Whittaker said
as he turned away, leaning more heavily on John&rsquo;s
arm. Closing his door he murmured &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; on
a breath, meaning, if he had troubled to say all he
meant, &ldquo;Well, well, see what we have here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romany Video, in a great fluff of feathery
negligee, lay face downward, a vibrant, hysterical
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
puff-ball, on the bed. She was a mere speck
of worried humanity troubling the white waste
spaces of Whittaker&rsquo;s four-poster; but an insistent
speck, like a mosquito at a screen. Whittaker regarded
her for a moment with an expression of
mingled amusement, pity, contempt, and the
faintly suggestive what-can-I-do-for-you look
certain men always have for a fair damsel in distress.
Thoroughly as Whittaker knew this particular
damsel, no distress of hers would quite leave
him indifferent.</p>
<p>But he took his time. There was no harm ever
came in letting a woman wait&mdash;or weep. He
said nothing. Sitting on the edge of the bed, as
though Romany were not there, he let John help
him exchange his pair of patent-leather for a pair
of pigskin slippers, remove his dinner-coat and stiff
shirt, and slip his green silk dressing-gown over
his shoulders. Romany, properly responsive to the
delayed attention, redoubled her sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, John. That&rsquo;ll do for now. No,
don&rsquo;t bother about my head. It&rsquo;s hardly more
than a mean bruise. I&rsquo;ll call you later if I want
you. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittaker, allowing John to depart, silently
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
studied the trembling, haired-up curls of Romany&rsquo;s
dishevelled head. Then, on the click of the latch,
he leaned across and touched her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, little one. What&rsquo;s it all about?
You&rsquo;re taking it too hard. I&rsquo;m sorry it had to be
Crawford to begin with&mdash;for your sake. But
you&rsquo;ll get over him, if you have time, as you got
over me. As you got over Blake. How did Blake
let you get over him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go away, you horrid, mean thing. I can&rsquo;t
bear you. Don&rsquo;t <i>talk</i> to me. Don&rsquo;t you <i>dare</i>
touch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As bad as all that? Dear, dear! You&rsquo;re taking
him harder than you took most of us. You
like them good, is that it? Gives you something to
do making them over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bad man! How can you say such things
to me? How <i>can</i> you, after all we&rsquo;ve been to each
other? You used never to do anything to hurt
me. And look at you now. What <i>has</i> happened,
Bertrand dear? It&rsquo;s such a cruel world. I can&rsquo;t
bear it. I tell you, I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to kill myself.
I&rsquo;m going to <i>die</i>, Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, for the first time of the hundred and
one you&rsquo;ve made that threat, there&rsquo;s a chance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
it&rsquo;s coming off,&rdquo; Whittaker said, and said the one
thing in creation that, instead of aggravating them,
could have stopped Romany&rsquo;s hysterics dead in
their tracks. Romany was quiet; desperately
quiet. She lifted her head from the foam of maribou
and looked at Whittaker with wide, distraught
eyes, and parted lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I say,&rdquo; he mocked her whisper by imitating
it. &ldquo;Even if you escape tonight, Romany
(for death, whose name you so often take in vain,
is on the <i>qui vive</i> in the house tonight), you have
Durian&rsquo;s death to answer for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romany screamed, and throttled the scream
with her hand across her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertrand! You are going&mdash;to tell&mdash;<i>that</i>?
You&rsquo;ve written it down as you wrote about Neil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no-no-no-no. Please, no. I don&rsquo;t believe
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wait and see. But hope isn&rsquo;t dead yet,
Freckles. (Let me see; yes, there&rsquo;s your one
freckle that made me call you Freckles. Remember?)
I&rsquo;ll have to find the Diary, or rewrite it,&mdash;unless,
of course, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.&rdquo;
Romany bounced back into her hair, her maribou,
and the rumpled pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> say that!&rdquo; he cried dramatically. And
Romany caught at a straw. She sat up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You care?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You <i>do</i> care. Oh,
Bertrand, <i>why</i> are you making me suffer so? I
don&rsquo;t understand. <i>Darling</i>, is it because you&rsquo;re
jealous?&rdquo; She threw both arms recklessly around
his neck and clung to him with the wild strength
of a drowning person. &ldquo;Did he think his little
Romany had really gone away and left him? Did
he think she cared about all the other mans?
Why, his poor little girl only thought the big man
had got tired of her. She did, darling. Truly,
she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittaker slowly and carefully, with all the
force of his hands, disengaged her arms, but, once
disengaged, he found his own of necessity engaged
in holding her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brat!&rdquo; he said, on a low, half-laugh, and kissed
her lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she breathed with a relieved sigh that
rose, softly, from the bottom of her heart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
so long since you called me that. I love it. How
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
<i>silly</i> of us to quarrel, Bertrand. And be jealous!
After all these years. To think you could ever
have been so cruel as to pretend to tell about
Durian to bring me back. Couldn&rsquo;t you have
found a pleasanter way, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittaker regarded her obliquely through half-shut
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Crawford?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She had the grace to color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Neil,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s for
him to take care of, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it is.&rdquo; She felt him shiver, but misinterpreted
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Devil has that reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt her take alarm again, with a defensive
stiffening. She laughed shakily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naughty boy! You&rsquo;re being sarcastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Romany sprang away from him and
stood trembling from head to foot, and chattering
with uncontrolled and unexpected rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are go-go-<i>going</i> to tell.&rdquo; She stuttered
feverishly. &ldquo;You are going to tell on all of us.
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
You r-really mean it. Don&rsquo;t you? D-don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve figured it out, have you? Yes, I&rsquo;m
telling. How often must I say it to get it through
your pretty head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brute! You beast! You&mdash;,&rdquo; like a
spoilt child Romany stamped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hateful,
cruel, wicked man. You can&rsquo;t do it. Just you
try. No one will let you. You&rsquo;ll be killed first.
You can&rsquo;t do it to me, do you hear. I&rsquo;ll kill you
myself. You&rsquo;ve got to leave me alone. Leave me
<i>alone</i>. What do you think I killed him for?
Because he betrayed me, didn&rsquo;t I? And what are
you doing to me? Betraying me, too. You look
out, Bertrand Whittaker. There&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;ll
stop at if I&rsquo;m roused. No, not even murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittaker shed Romany&rsquo;s tantrum as a duck
sheds water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Histrionics, baby,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You never can
get far away from them, can you? Fifth-rate
quotations from sixth-rate melodrama. Not that
I don&rsquo;t wish you meant your big threat. I do.
But if you really mean to kill me, don&rsquo;t shout
about it. The house is listening, if I know the
house. Do it on the quiet. Now run away home
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
to your room, child, and think it over. I&rsquo;ll drop
in later, if I may, and get the results. Pity I
haven&rsquo;t the poor old diary by me and I&rsquo;d mark you
the passages about yourself. They&rsquo;re quite thrilling.
Make you out a sort of Medici, of the
willow-wand variety. You should be honored.&rdquo;
Romany swayed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t faint, my dear, <i>again</i>.
You do it too often. It&rsquo;s becoming a vicious
habit. The thing for you to do is to get to bed.&rdquo;
Whittaker worked her gently toward the door.
&ldquo;Goodnight&mdash;sleep tight&mdash;wake up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romany drew away from him with a shudder.
Wrapping her gown tightly about her with a
pathetic little gesture of pride and courage, she
flung a parting shot from the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re the only one that can
tell tales out of school, Bertrand Whittaker. I&rsquo;ll
match you revelation for revelation if it comes to
the book of revelations. You&rsquo;ll have a tall lot of
explaining to do to the law if I let&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in the hall, and had dropped her voice.
Whittaker failed to catch a name she gave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ll let the world know about?&rdquo;
he shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Romany put her dust-mop head back into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Just you guess!</i> And I hope you die of
fright,&rdquo; she hissed, and, turtle-wise, withdrew the
head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII</h2>
<p>Julian, in dressing gown and slippers, sank back
in the deep arm-chair before the fire burning in his
room, and gave himself up to being downright worried.
The situation at Thorngate seemed to him
bewildering, terrifying, and positively insane, by
turns. Obviously there was far more real trouble
in the wind than the immediate problem of his
own predicament, though heaven knew that was
bad enough, largely because of Joel. However he
was in a sense relieved and glad that Joel was to
know. He had never yet been able to figure out
a way to tell her about himself, but now this came
along to settle the matter for him: she was bound
to know, willy-nilly.</p>
<p>Why, <i>why</i> had he ever told Bertrand Whittaker
of all people? No one would have ever been any
the wiser if he had kept his mouth shut that warm
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
evening last summer when his conscience was eating
him alive, together with the mosquitoes, and he
had asked Whittaker what to do about it. Whittaker
had said, &ldquo;Oh, forget it, boy. It won&rsquo;t do
you, or Roger Dane, or Roger&rsquo;s family any good
to come out with it.&rdquo; Then why was Whittaker
so thoroughly airing it now? Or was he? Perhaps
he considered Julian&rsquo;s hot-headed crime of too
light a weight to bother with in his gruesome Diary.
But Julian felt that it was playing ostrich on his
part to rely on such a hope. For a man is known
by the company he keeps. And it began to be
desperately certain that the house was full to the
gables of murderers in one degree or another. Both
Blake and Dorn had been too quick on the rise to
speak well for themselves. Romany Monte Video
and Neil Crawford had blown to bits under a little
pressure. And the Diary had been of sufficient
importance for someone to have already attempted
murder for its sake. Murder to cover murder.
What a weird and preposterous household it was
proving to be. What was Bertrand Whittaker&rsquo;s
motive in assembling it unless he was playing a losing
game with death? If Crawford were not so
chicken-hearted he would have avenged tonight&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
dreadful betrayal before now. He might get
around to it yet. Some of the rankest cowards in
an open fight have been known to be excellent
stabbers-in-the-back. And if everyone else had
a secret murder in his past, whoever got away with
the Diary was getting a wonderful thrill&mdash;probably
reading it now by flashlight in a cupboard or
under the shrubbery (one of Julian&rsquo;s most persistent
fears was that Dorn, instead of having gone
straight up to town, was haunting the grounds with
murder in his heart), trembling at every creak of
the floor or rustle of leaves.</p>
<p>Whittaker&rsquo;s chances of seeing his scheme through
appeared slim enough to Julian: but even should he
fail to see a rewritten version of his Diary in print,
he had already, by one evening&rsquo;s work, made a rotten
mess of at least six lives. Neil and Sydney and
Romany could no longer ignore their situation;
whatever was between them would from now on
be an open wound. Belknap would have definite
proof of at least one crime and the criminal behind
it. Whether, in view of the preposterous and unfair
circumstances, he would decently ignore Crawford&rsquo;s
guilt was a doubtful question. Romany had
fainted dead away when the Diary was first mentioned,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
and later had lost her head and confused the
names of Neil Crawford and that lover of hers,
with the crazy name of Durian, who had been accidently
killed in one of her plays&mdash;why, of <i>course</i>,
he <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i> been accidentally killed, that was just it.
What a fool he was not to have thought of it before?
So now he had three murderers accounted
for: Crawford, Romany, and himself. As for
Nadia, she looked the part of a poisoner to the letter.
Dorn had clearly run away from something.
With Blake it probably all depended on your definition
of a duel.</p>
<p>But then there was Joel! Something must be
wrong with his whole figuring, or Joel wouldn&rsquo;t be
where she was. Surely Whittaker wouldn&rsquo;t include
an innocent niece in a crime wave unless
there were others as innocent to make it proper.
Julian smiled at his own charming conceit. But
it might be that Whittaker was so intent on crushing
the alliance between himself and Joel that he
was taking drastic measures to acquaint Joel with
her lover&rsquo;s villainy. He <i>must</i> see Joel. He must
see her before things developed beyond anyone&rsquo;s
control, as they were rapidly doing.</p>
<p>He jumped to his feet and almost out of his skin
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
at a tapping on an inner door of his room that led
God knew where. Should he lie low and gaze hypnotized
at the door knob, or shout boldly &ldquo;Come
in,&rdquo; or open the door suddenly and take the intruder
off his guard? Julian had by now strung
himself up to such a pitch that his own murder
wouldn&rsquo;t in the least have surprised him. Before
he could decide on a course of action the door
quietly opened and Joel appeared in a flowing blue
robe. All his breath deserted him at the vision
of her in his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joel!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I&rsquo;m on the other side of the door,
with the key on my side. Must be more plot in
that, don&rsquo;t you think? If we fall any deeper into
trouble than we have fallen already&mdash;I mean if it
comes to calling the police or something&mdash;there&rsquo;ll
be a scandal about the connecting door between
the rooms of Mr. Julian Prentice and his fianc&eacute;e.
Fianc&eacute;e my eye, it will suggest! And if, hearing
a shot, we should dash into the hall, it would add
that we were seen emerging from the young gentleman&rsquo;s
room, in negligee, at&mdash;&rdquo; she glanced at her
wrist watch&mdash;&ldquo;at 12:30 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> The fact that I
am marking the time, with you as witness, may
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
prove frightfully important. It <i>is</i> late, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, yes.&rdquo; Julian&rsquo;s over-emotion at Joel&rsquo;s
nearness showed itself in understatement and a boyish
stiffness that made Joel love him beyond anything.
&ldquo;Come and sit here, won&rsquo;t you? While I
stir this fire. What <i>are</i> you doing out so late, dear
heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did a little listening and snooping in the halls
and found everybody else doing likewise. So I
naturally can&rsquo;t sleep. The house is fairly creeping,
Julian. I wish it would get to its feet and walk
off. Perhaps in the sense of very strong cheese, it
will eventually. Oh dear, I&rsquo;m so tired, and therefore
a little silly, as you see, darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder&mdash;that you&rsquo;re tired I mean.
Here, put your feet on this cushion and let me
warm your hands that are so cold. Tell me, Joel,
what do you think your uncle is up to; what is he
doing to everybody, including himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; truly, Julian, I don&rsquo;t know, and I
don&rsquo;t care what he is doing to himself and all the
others but us. But I do care dreadfully what he
does to you and me, and I have come to see whether
we can&rsquo;t, you and I, pass a magic wand over ourselves
to keep out his evil genius and whatever it&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
leading to. That we may even begin to do it, I
realize I must be very brave and tell you about
myself. We can&rsquo;t in the face of things leave any
stone unturned between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian looked up at her with a swift, tender
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are going to tell me <i>you</i> have committed
murder, too,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian, be still; don&rsquo;t be amused. Yes, I am going
to tell you that I have committed murder. I
have. But listen, please; don&rsquo;t laugh that way. I
can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling, I can&rsquo;t help it. Oh my God, I was
just coming to tell you about my murder before
you should hear about it from another, or read of it
in a tabloid, or have it sprung upon you when I am
cross-examined. Joel, we are in for a very great
deal of horridness&mdash;worse than we realize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not worse than <i>I</i> realize,&rdquo; she said, with inexpressible
weariness. &ldquo;Julian dearest, you must
listen to me; and then,&rdquo; she smiled faintly, &ldquo;I will
hear about your murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put her hands to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; she said, drawing back. &ldquo;Perhaps you
won&rsquo;t feel that way when I&rsquo;ve told you. After
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
all if you have killed one&mdash;husband&mdash;.&rdquo; She
found it almost beyond her to say the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joel, you didn&rsquo;t kill Jerry. You didn&rsquo;t, you
didn&rsquo;t. Say it, I tell you. Say you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. But it wasn&rsquo;t quite a murder, really it
wasn&rsquo;t. Listen, Julian, stop crying. I swear to
you it wasn&rsquo;t altogether a murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean &lsquo;not altogether a
murder.&rsquo; Murder is murder, you can&rsquo;t get away
from that.&rdquo; Julian&rsquo;s tone was low and dull.
&ldquo;Joel, I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought being in a glass house
you wouldn&rsquo;t throw stones,&rdquo; bitterness had crept
into her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine was self-defense&mdash;in a way it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine was an affair of honor&mdash;in a way it
was. I am going to tell you the whole story. It&rsquo;s
our only hope, Julian&mdash;for us both to tell everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry and I had been in love, really and terribly
in love, for several years. It was after we knew
Junior was on his way that we married. Oh, not
because we <i>had</i> to. It was Jerry&rsquo;s idea that we&rsquo;d
call that our own private marriage, if we found
that we could have one, and then accept the necessary
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
legalities for its sake. You see what I mean.
I thought it a sort of romantic super-modernism, a
beautiful way of counting out the world. Don&rsquo;t
laugh at me, Julian; for the laugh <i>was</i> on me. The
first shock came when we knew. He said, &lsquo;I wonder
whether we really <i>need</i> to go through the outward
form!&rsquo; Puzzled, but no more, I said, &lsquo;Of
course, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rsquo; and his answer was,
&lsquo;Just as you say, of course.&rsquo; &lsquo;As <i>you</i> say,&rsquo; note
that. It took me months of increasing pain to
realize that it wasn&rsquo;t romance for him, but a way
of keeping free himself while achieving a son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought it all out; and it seemed to me I
had been deceived as surely as any girl in melodrama.
After all it&rsquo;s six of one and half a dozen of
the other, the old Tess of the D&rsquo;Urberville way and
the modern, talking-it-all-out way, isn&rsquo;t it? Instead
of the enraged father and brother going on
the warpath (fathers and brothers have been made
to feel gun-shy these days) the woman herself,
whose boast is that she can take care of herself,
should have more than the theoretical right to do it.
She should be able to fight it out to the death. Call
it a new form of dueling if you like. So I went to
work to clear my honor. That&rsquo;s what it amounted
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
to. I had ceased to care, to love him, of course, or
I suppose I couldn&rsquo;t have done it. I took shooting
lessons at the 79th St. Armory. <i>He</i> had been a
good shot since the War. Then I challenged him,
coolly and seriously. I meant it. I named the
hour, and the spot (in Central Park), and said he
could name the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Joel</i>, what did he say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughed. I suppose I should have known
he would. But I was made blind angry by it. So
I went for a gun and&mdash;ended it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get away with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend to. But I had taken his pistol
from the drawer&mdash;and that, with the position in
which he lay, pointed to suicide. It was never
finger printed. Our friends claimed we were the
most devoted couple they knew. I went to Uncle
Bertrand immediately (he was Judge in our Precinct
at the time), but he persuaded me, wrongly
I know now, to keep silent; he said Jerry had it
coming to him. But I wish I&rsquo;d just run away from
him instead.&rdquo; Joel was crying with eyes wide
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joel dear, you poor extraordinary child. I
would have killed him for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but you weren&rsquo;t around in those days;
and besides, it was the feeling of defending my own
name that made me do it. I wouldn&rsquo;t have brooked
a <i>man&rsquo;s</i> defending me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve got to do something about your
uncle, what would an extra murder more or less
have mattered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t stop my
uncle if he is bound and determined, even by
killing him. He would have a way of getting
around his own murder, if it took his ghost to do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t try murder, sweetheart. But I am going
to have a talk with him&mdash;<i>tonight</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian stood up and bent over to kiss her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back soon, I promise. Don&rsquo;t you move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian, please stay. I don&rsquo;t want to be left
alone in this awful house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the door had closed behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c9">IX</h2>
<p>And down the corridor Neil Crawford closed
another door behind himself and Sydney. Their
eyes met with a bleak and hopeless questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Neil,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;What are we going
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am <i>I</i> going to, you must say, Sydney.
Remember, my dear, you are not in this. And remember
that whatever I do or don&rsquo;t do will be
entirely governed by my love for you and my desire
to <i>keep</i> you and the children out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>can&rsquo;t</i> keep me out of it, Neil, even if you
wanted to. That is the way, with things relating
to one or other of two people who are closely
united, both are in them for good or bad. So I&rsquo;m
in this with you to the very last&mdash;that is, if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I want you?&rdquo; He took her shoulders in
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
either hand. &ldquo;Is that what you are trying to say?
You know I want you. You know I love you, that
I never have loved, never will love, anyone but you.
I can&rsquo;t help myself. We were made in patterns
that match, like a jig-saw puzzle. We wouldn&rsquo;t
match anyone else, no one else would match us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did her best to control the wave of feeling
that made her draw free of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t feel so, Neil, or think you do. She
loves you; and said it tonight too definitely to make
me feel you have not returned in kind. Neil,
where are our promises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, Sydney, since when were you such
an innocent as to think promises were anything
more than baubles, pretty but&mdash;but vain. The
promises to love forever until death do us part&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, Neil! You know as well as I do
that those aren&rsquo;t the promises I am thinking of.
Besides, we never made those particular promises.
But we did promise we weren&rsquo;t going to go living
around with other people unless we <i>meant</i> it&mdash;meant
it down to the ground, do you hear me?&rdquo;
She was trying to keep her voice under control, but
it would rise spasmodically. &ldquo;And here you seem
to have done just that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t just living around, Sydney. You know
me well enough to know I&rsquo;d be fastidious about
such things. Romany and I got into it somehow,
quite naturally. Why can&rsquo;t women realize how
little such things mean to a man, and to some
women. She&rsquo;s one of them. We&rsquo;ve never spoken
of love; do you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neil, how silly to say such a thing, when by its
very nature love is somehow involved. In the very
essence of it&mdash;your winnowing of the physical
from the spiritual&mdash;it is the ruin of all idealism.
Someone we know, who was it, was saying the
other day that the trouble with the younger generation
is that it lacks guts. You are exactly what
he meant, Neil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be vulgar about it, Sydney. Vulgarity
doesn&rsquo;t suit you. Only the sophisticated can get
away with it. Your delicacy is one of the reasons
I care for you. And I <i>do</i> care. You can&rsquo;t say I
don&rsquo;t love you, or you me. Can you say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which only makes it frightfully much worse.
And don&rsquo;t lie to me. She couldn&rsquo;t have written
you a letter like that if you hadn&rsquo;t used love, in
one form or another, toward her. Don&rsquo;t quibble
about the meaning of the word love.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;such a letter&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a letter on your desk, Neil. I had to read
it, you can see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you got just what was coming to you,
Sydney. Even a wife, a wife least of all, doesn&rsquo;t
read a man&rsquo;s private correspondence unless she
wants to get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! Say it if you will. It can&rsquo;t make
matters any more terrible than they are. I saw the
address on the envelope (I knew she had been in
Hollywood this spring), and in a flash I remembered
that&mdash;that night. It&rsquo;s asking too much of
human nature to ask it to turn its back on the truth
at such a moment. And you can&rsquo;t say it isn&rsquo;t better
to know the truth at whatever cost to us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think so, yes.&rdquo; Crawford&rsquo;s anger died as
he saw her face change. &ldquo;Oh, Sydney, don&rsquo;t look
at me like that. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> sorry.&rdquo; He
tried to take her hands and failed. &ldquo;And now this
other thing to hurt you. I can&rsquo;t endure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This other is bad, yes. But not really bad, my
dear, as compared to my trust and respect, trust in
you and self-respect, splintered to atoms overnight.
Bertrand Whittaker can do his worst, can put you
behind bars, and me talking to you through bars,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
but it won&rsquo;t be a patch on the edge taken off what
we have been years in building. Marriages aren&rsquo;t
built in a day. There must be something wrong
with me and my dreams, I suppose. Before we left
home tonight I happened to pick up a picture of
Bunny, and realized it was the one that had been
in the town house all winter, watching you&mdash;watching
you&mdash;,&rdquo; she trailed off helplessly. &ldquo;I
seem so to confuse illusions and realities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t confuse them. Don&rsquo;t have illusions.
Yet that&rsquo;s why I love you, for the image you make
of a perfect life. But it can&rsquo;t be lived, Sydney.
It can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Our</i> chance is gone, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it affects us in the least if our
love remains to us. I have never told her I loved
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How charming for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what she wanted. She understands.
I&rsquo;m not the only one for her. It isn&rsquo;t as
if she were&mdash; She can take care of herself.&rdquo; He
paused. &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if she were dead
if it would do us any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neil, hush! Nothing, not even our own
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
deaths, could do us any real good again. How can
you think wrong will right wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know how I think a lot
of things I&rsquo;m thinking. For instance, Bertrand
Whittaker must be stopped dead in his tracks. He
can&rsquo;t be allowed to do this to Bunny&rsquo;s life, or yours,
or mine either. I&rsquo;ll kill him first. The past is
over and done with and he has no right to revive
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The past is over; yes, the past is done with.
She said she had your picture and Bunny&rsquo;s on the
dresser before her. Listen to that&mdash;<i>Bunny&rsquo;s</i> picture.
What&rsquo;s Bunny to her under the circumstances,
I&rsquo;d like to know, that she should be able to
make free with her picture: stepchild, love child or
godchild? I don&rsquo;t suppose any of them fit, but
they sound so refreshingly shocking it&rsquo;s fun to use
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stop</i> making a scene, Sydney! I didn&rsquo;t think
you had it in you to make scenes and say such wild,
bitter things. I can&rsquo;t <i>tend</i> to a scene now. Can&rsquo;t
you <i>see</i> I can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did it all begin, Neil? Don&rsquo;t say it began
in the common old-fashioned way at the common
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
old-fashioned time. Don&rsquo;t say it began when
Bunny was coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it did. When did you think it would
have begun? You didn&rsquo;t expect me to be a monk,
did you? Sydney, let&rsquo;s stop talking, please; and
think about what&rsquo;s got to be done. What do you
say we clear out of the country and make a fresh
start. Australia or somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fresh start! How devastating it sounds&mdash;to
start over after eight years. It can&rsquo;t be done,
and the soul still live. As if one were told, after a
terrible day of sled-pulling in an Arctic storm, that
one had to retrace one&rsquo;s steps without rest or food.
It couldn&rsquo;t be done, and the body live. That&rsquo;s
how I feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sydney, quiet. Quiet, dear, you must stop.
And help me plan. I must find Giordano. I see
it clearly. I must find him tonight. He will deal
with Whittaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, no, no. You mustn&rsquo;t get in touch
with those men again. You are finished forever if
you try that. Neil, don&rsquo;t do anything rash. I&rsquo;ll
talk to Bertrand the minute I have a chance. He
will listen to reason. You know we have always
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
said the day might come, and we promised to keep
our heads. Our promises again! She said the rain
where she was made her remember your night rains.
Neil, Neil! what does that do to our rains, our
trains, our meteorites, our&mdash;our&mdash;.&rdquo; She was
sobbing now with a desperate tearless exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Nothing. It doesn&rsquo;t do anything
to them, dearest one. We have our love. With
Romany, as we agreed, it was all just a symbol.
Do you hear me, Sydney? Stop crying. Stop it.
I have something that has to be done. <i>Stop it.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the telephone on the stand between
the beds. She screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away from that telephone, Neil. Can&rsquo;t
you see what frightful things may be going to happen
in this house tonight. A call can be traced&mdash;you
mustn&rsquo;t <i>touch</i> a telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang toward him; but he had lifted the receiver
and she couldn&rsquo;t struggle or argue with him
against the ear of the operator. The number he
gave was AUdubon 2-1801. It answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello. Crawford speaking.&rdquo; Then he never
<i>had</i> been out of touch with them. &ldquo;Pick up Disuno
if you can find him. If not, one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
others. The address is Bertrand Whittaker&rsquo;s, Blue
Acres. Outside the park gates at three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil hung up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made the mistake of your life, Neil
Crawford. If a breath of what you have just done
reaches the police it&rsquo;s all over but the shouting,
Bertrand or no Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s certainly all over if I do nothing. No,
this is going to be Whittaker&rsquo;s life or mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordway Belknap may be here for a purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have foiled better men than Belknap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been with them ever since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t for a minute imagine I could have
been anywhere else did you? Once with them always
with them as far as the underworld is concerned.
They never release us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never told me how it has been with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have helped in the least. I&rsquo;ve
saved Giordano from the chair twice over. And
Disuno hasn&rsquo;t hide nor hair that he doesn&rsquo;t owe to
me. Now I need them, that&rsquo;s all. And you, my
dear. And always you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her in his arms now, but she was
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
strangely unresponsive. For her the living spark
of whatever it was that had existed between them,
whether love is the word to call it or not she had
never known anyway, was as snuffed out as though
it had never been.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c10">X</h2>
<p>Belknap entered his room just before dawn and
turned up the light. Nadia stood against the wall
inside the door, both hands at her throat, her breath
coming in gasps. Her face in the sudden light was
as pale as the under side of willow leaves before a
storm, or after. Here it seemed that the storm
must have passed a moment since.</p>
<p>Belknap sprang to her and seized both her wrists
in one vice-like grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nadia! you haven&rsquo;t done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I haven&rsquo;t done <i>it</i>, as you call it,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>have</i> you been doing then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been running, my dear detective; don&rsquo;t
you see that?&rdquo; She tried to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What from? I thought nothing
could ever frighten you. Once and for all, Nadia
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
Mdevani,&rdquo; he continued as her eyes fell before his,
&ldquo;I ask you to keep out of this. Can&rsquo;t you begin to
see what I am here for? I am here for game, and
you are not fair game. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s that you
are too fair.&rdquo; His voice wavered. &ldquo;Anyway,
keep clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Mr. Belknap. On my soul, I can&rsquo;t.
There is too much at stake. If I were the only
one. But I am not.&rdquo; She handed him a slip of
paper that had been crumpled in her hand.</p>
<p>He took it to the table, and smoothed it under
his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you follow instructions?&rdquo; he asked, in a
low voice. &ldquo;Is that what the running was about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. I didn&rsquo;t do it, on my word of honor.&rdquo;
Then her eyes suddenly lifted wide open. &ldquo;There
is someone in the hall behind me. Do you hear?&rdquo;
Her body was stiff, her face frozen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belknap, matching the softness of her
voice. &ldquo;But it seems quite possible. It <i>would</i> be
strange if you and I were the only ones abroad in
the house tonight, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered. They stood motionless.
&ldquo;It is going downstairs. Oh my God, it will find it.
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
Do something, Belknap. Quick, destroy that paper,
if you love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long, long scream penetrated the house from
corner to corner, like a knife thrust. And then
the silence fell again. Nadia drew a deep, shuddering
breath, and when she spoke her voice was
stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had better go down, Mr. Belknap.
Something seems to be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something does. You may come with me if
you care to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went down and to the door of the library
where there was a light. Sydney Crawford stood
over a body lying crumpled on the floor. The
body was Hartley Blake&rsquo;s, and was stabbed so well
and so often as to have watered the rug thickly
with blood.</p>
<p>Sydney, with stricken eyes, met Belknap&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have
screamed, but it was a little unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap turned on his heel and rang the service
bell. He crossed to the telephone on Whittaker&rsquo;s
desk and lifted the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Mrs. Crawford. You, too, Miss
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
Mdevani. Don&rsquo;t look at the body. I shall have
the police here in a moment. But perhaps I can
help you, Mrs. Crawford, if you have anything to
say to me before they arrive. I shall undoubtedly
be on the case, since I have had the misfortune to
be at Thorngate this week-end&mdash;(Police Department?
Ordway Belknap speaking. You may or
may not know my name. I am up at Judge Whittaker&rsquo;s
place. Yes, Whittaker. There has been a
murder committed here during the night. Body
just discovered. You had better send up a sergeant
with a few men. The guests, I am afraid,
will have to be held. Pick up a doctor of course.
Right you are.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up, and crossed to the divan for a
lounging robe which he flung quickly and deftly
over Blake&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blake&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; he said to Julian and Joel who
had just put in an appearance. &ldquo;The police are on
their way. Meanwhile, if you will excuse me, I
shall look the ground over. Seems to have been an
impulsive affair,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;with the knife
left behind.&rdquo; He picked up the long, thin, bronze
paper-knife, which lay, stained with blood, a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
to the left of the body. There was also a woman&rsquo;s
lace handkerchief, which Belknap offered to Sydney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not mine,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say,&rdquo; Belknap replied, thrusting it
into his pocket. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know whose it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John came to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you want me, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, John. Will you round up everyone in
the house, including the help. There has been a
murder. Colonel Blake. The police will want
you all for questioning. Not that most of you
aren&rsquo;t here already,&rdquo; Belknap smiled at the room.
Crawford had come in on Julian&rsquo;s heels. Romany
and Whittaker, however, were still absent.</p>
<p>Belknap bent to the body and examined rapidly
and thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the off chance we might find something,
Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;If Blake, under
cover of darkness, returned for a cach&eacute;d Diary and
met his death because of it, the murderer may not
have had time to relieve him before you, or shall we
say I, appeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sydney made no answer; but her two lovely
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
hands lifted from her lap in a little helpless gesture
of futility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite obvious,&rdquo; Julian said unexpectedly,
&ldquo;that you intend to make Mrs. Crawford responsible
for Colonel Blake&rsquo;s death, Mr. Belknap. I feel
called upon to ask you to keep your suspicions, even
such proof as you may have, until a moment more
in keeping with judicial etiquette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap flushed darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on our detective, Mr. Prentice,&rdquo;
Nadia cried. &ldquo;He does not suspect Mrs.
Crawford of this ghastly affair, but he very much
wishes he did. And the wish has been father to the
possibility. He really suspects me. Therein lies
the difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare the noble gesture, Nadia.&rdquo; Whittaker
was standing in the door. &ldquo;<i>I</i> suspect you myself
when you go altruistic. Ah, Belknap! in your element
I see! I can&rsquo;t believe it. Blake murdered!
That it should have happened in my house. Terrible!
John said he was unable to rouse Romany
with his knock, so I sent one of the maids to her
room. And I gave orders for the servants to wait
in the hall. Does that meet with your approval,
Belknap? I shall sit down, if I may. Last night
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
and this morning, taken together, are more than is
good for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sank heavily into a chair there was a windy
bustle at the front door, a careless, strident laugh,
and a stamping of feet, that in its sincere disrespect
for the traditions and restraint of Thorngate, announced
the arrival of the police. Belknap stepped
toward the library door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, Sergeant. We have been waiting for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Sergeant me, Belknap,&rdquo; came a pleasant,
resonant answer from the hall; and a man of medium
stature, with clear, blue eyes and gold-bronze
hair, faced him in the doorway. &ldquo;Your humble
servant. It&rsquo;s nice to see you again. I&rsquo;m only sorry
for one thing, that you have the jump on me as
usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Berry! Why, land alive, where did <i>you</i> come
from? Don&rsquo;t worry about being a step behind
me. There&rsquo;s going to be plenty for both of us.
Come in. Whittaker, you know Lieutenant Berry.
There&rsquo;s only one other in the room important
enough for you to meet at the moment. Berry,
this is Colonel Blake. Colonel, Lieutenant Berry
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
has come to see what he can do for you.&rdquo; Belknap
indicated the body with a motion of his hand.
&ldquo;You brought a doctor? It will be convenient to
know about when death occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Doctor Giles is here. Giles,&rdquo; he called.
&ldquo;Get on the job, will you? Come along in, Sergeant.
This is Sergeant Stebbins, Ordway Belknap;
Belknap, Sergeant Stebbins. Now, old man, what&rsquo;s
the story? The sooner we catch the scent the better.
When did you arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the trouble began. That may help us,
and it may not. What do <i>you</i> say, Whittaker?
Shall I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s voice was heard in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judge! Lily has fallen downstairs. I
think it&rsquo;s a faint, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick her up,&rdquo; said Whittaker.</p>
<p>John and two cops between them lifted her to
the library couch.</p>
<p>Berry glanced at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the superstition that the object last beheld
leaves its mark branded on the face I should say
your Lily had been seeing things! Where has <i>she</i>
been?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the room of one of the guests,&rdquo; Belknap
said. &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lily opened both eyes and gazed glassily at
the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Romany&rsquo;s stiffer&rsquo;n a post,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c11">XI</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo; said Belknap quickly, &ldquo;will you
and Berry go up to Miss Video&rsquo;s room? John,
show them up. You may begin to notice there&rsquo;s
something damn wrong with things around here.
There <i>is</i>. And I must have a word with the Judge
alone. He&rsquo;s the one to bring it to a standstill&mdash;if
there is still time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seized Whittaker by the arm and half led,
half pushed him into the dining-room. Berry and
Stebbins made the stairs three at a bound. Julian
dragged Joel onto the terrace outside the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian&mdash;<i>darling</i>,&rdquo; Joel protested, &ldquo;<i>please</i> leave
me alone. I must go to bed. I&rsquo;m ill, really I am;
and so is poor Uncle Bertrand. Didn&rsquo;t you see
how frightfully he looked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t poor your Uncle Bertrand in front
of me, Joel. If you begin sticking up for him now
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
that he&rsquo;s in such a pickle you and I part company.
He&rsquo;s downright responsible for the whole mess.
And don&rsquo;t you dare talk about going to bed either.
I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to talk to you&mdash;to you or someone else&mdash;or
I&rsquo;ll simply burst. And I refuse to burst in front
of Belknap. You must spare me that, dear. Now
listen to me.&rdquo; His voice fell almost to a whisper.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a clue&mdash;a <i>clue</i>, do you hear me? A
tangible clue! Darling, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> shut your eyes.
Look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian produced a little square of fool&rsquo;s cap with
letters as unintelligible to Joel as hieroglyphics typed
across it. Joel feverishly rubbed out its network
of wrinkles and squinted at it as though she were
near-sighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Julian, I don&rsquo;t want to know about this.
Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s get mixed up in it. Let&rsquo;s run away,
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Run away!</i> Me? Why it&rsquo;s the chance of a
life-time to make a reputation for myself. You
aren&rsquo;t going to be the kind of wife that asks her
husband to sacrifice himself for her on the eve
of establishing his career, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o&mdash;only I&rsquo;m afraid of it, like a bomb. I&rsquo;d
rather somebody else handled it. Let&rsquo;s take it to
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
that sergeant, or Mr. Belknap, or Lieutenant Berry.
Perhaps it&rsquo;s really important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Perhaps</i> it&rsquo;s important. I like that. It <i>is</i> important.
It&rsquo;s a code message. A <i>code</i>. And
codes are my middle name. Didn&rsquo;t you know that,
darling? Good in arithmetic, fair in geography,
poor in deportment, rank in spellin&rsquo;; but perfect
in codes. I know as much about codes as that
Philo Vance man knows about all other subjects
put together. I have an idea he crams, while I
have made codes my life work. Began in grade
school behind those old desk tops we used to have,
do you remember, when what was learned on top
was nothing to what was learned under cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Julian, do stop fooling. If you get into
one of your fooling moods there&rsquo;ll be no keeping
even these murders serious. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, if
you know so much about codes, don&rsquo;t keep me in
suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult code, Joel. One of the toughest.
That Japanese thing they used during the War.
But I&rsquo;ve figured it. Listen. &lsquo;Blake has been tapping
the STC wires. This week-end is your chance.
Get him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addressed to whom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Addressed</i>, stupid! You didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d
write a code and address it, did you? If it came
here at all it came by messenger, of course. But
it&rsquo;s unlikely it came here. Whoever received it
brought it with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we knew who received it, it would at
least settle Colonel Blake&rsquo;s murder, wouldn&rsquo;t it?
Oh, Julian, you <i>are</i> clever. Where did you get
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the stairs as I came down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian, it&rsquo;s a wonder you&rsquo;re alive! To think
<i>you</i>&rsquo;ve been the first to pick up a clue with all these
great detectives about. And where were you all
night? I waited and waited&mdash;and worried and
worried&mdash; Why didn&rsquo;t you come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joel, I&rsquo;m so sorry. Truly I am. But do you
know what I did, dearest? I went to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>sleep</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sleep, that&rsquo;s what I said.&rdquo; Julian came to
his own rescue before her tone of reproach.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny about that? I was tired. I
went to your uncle&rsquo;s room and he wasn&rsquo;t there.
So I waited. I dropped off on the lounge. He
never came back as far as I know. When I woke
it was all hours. I&rsquo;d heard nothing. And coming
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
out into the hall I was welcomed by Mrs. Crawford&rsquo;s
reveille.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian, how <i>can</i> you say such things. When
I&rsquo;m feeling so terribly, too. <i>Do</i> make me rest
somehow, dear. My head&mdash;my eyes&mdash; No,
there isn&rsquo;t time for it, I know. We must take your
wonderful clue to Mr. Belknap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Belknap, sweetheart. Never Belknap.
He has the fanatic&rsquo;s eye and it doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me.
Perhaps Berry, sometime. I rather cotton to Berry.
But for the nonce I hunt alone. I might accomplish
miracles with a dash of luck. You must
realize I have a deductive mind&mdash;as well as a
<i>se</i>ductive, darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Please&mdash; Don&rsquo;t.</i> I can&rsquo;t play with you. We
must go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Go where was settled on the instant by what
Julian would have sworn were two shots in rapid
succession, which rang out in the interior of the
house. Two policemen, guns in hand, breath
shortening, came scuttling around opposite corners
of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoner&rsquo;s Base or Run Sheep Run?&rdquo; asked
Julian delightedly. &ldquo;Or just plain catch-as-catch-can?&rdquo;
he added, springing ahead of them into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
library. Nadia sat alone in the room&mdash;with
Blake&rsquo;s body almost at her feet. Her head lay back
on the divan top. A lighted cigarette hung between
very red lips. She had taken time out to
make up. There was not the flicker of an expression
in the more than usually mask-like face. Nor
did it unbend as Belknap opened the dining-room
door, asking for Doctor Giles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick. I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ve got Whittaker.
Where in Hell are the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittaker lay huddled over the table, his face
in his arms. Dr. Giles&rsquo; hasty examination showed
that he had been shot from behind. The bullet
had entered below the left shoulder blade, passed
through the heart (death being instantaneous),
and lodged in the table, splintering the wood deeply.
Berry remarked on the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close range, that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you <i>sure</i>
there was no one else in the room, Belknap? Could
someone have slipped in behind you both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems very unlikely. I should have said the
shot came from the direction of the library. But
I myself was facing that particular door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were two shots fired,&rdquo; said Julian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Prentice.&rdquo; Belknap
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
was short in his speech. &ldquo;There was one shot fired
as you can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. Every shot doesn&rsquo;t hit its
mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted. But that will be ascertained in due
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Stebbins had been a strong and silent
man since his arrival. A square-headed, ruddy-cheeked,
heavy-jowled man, he gave the appearance
of being a stone wall instead of a hurdle to
anyone who didn&rsquo;t take him cautiously. And
something in Belknap&rsquo;s last remark seemed to have
set his back up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Due course!&rdquo; he rumbled. &ldquo;Due course! I
guess that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been the whole trouble around
here. You&rsquo;ve been taking your time, haven&rsquo;t you?
Due course! In all your fancy detective work,
Mr. Belknap, haven&rsquo;t you caught on that when it&rsquo;s
one murder you act quick, when it&rsquo;s two you jump
into it, and when it&rsquo;s three greased lightning
shouldn&rsquo;t have a look-in. I&rsquo;m sorry to say it, but I
think there&rsquo;s been criminal negligence, Detective.
Three murders in as many hours is rather a record
in <i>my</i> observation, and under your very nose, so to
speak. It&rsquo;s clearly my duty to put everyone in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
house under arrest. You&rsquo;re damn lucky I don&rsquo;t
include you. Now we&rsquo;ll get down to brass tacks.
A little examining of witnesses won&rsquo;t come amiss.
Who was in the library when the Judge got his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was; and I was there alone.&rdquo; Nadia was contemptuous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so, lady,&rdquo; Stebbins said. &ldquo;You look
the kind. We&rsquo;ll begin with you. The rest of you
can clear out of here; and wait your turn in there.&rdquo;
He signified the library with a twist of his thumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute, Sergeant,&rdquo; Belknap coldly interceded.
&ldquo;My impulse of course is to pick you up
by the neck and throw you out, your silly nickel
badge to the contrary. But, strange as it may seem
to you, I have a positively fiendish desire to get to
the root of this succession of violent crimes that
have spoiled a good week-end. That I happened to
be present in an unofficial capacity may be a misfortune
in a sense. Privately speaking, it is. But
it has also given me certain angles of an extraordinary
situation that you could never arrive at if you
questioned yourself blue in the face. Whether or
not you may wish to take advantage of what I
have to offer is <i>another</i> question. I assure you it
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
will be perfectly agreeable to me to paddle my own
canoe, and let you paddle yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, boys,&rdquo; Berry interrupted quietly.
&ldquo;My dear Stebbins, you and Belknap had better
get together on this. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all determined
upon clearing things up as rapidly and expeditiously
as possible. You and I naturally recognize that
Mr. Belknap is in a most embarrassing position; and
it is more than decent of him to remain on the case.
But since he has agreed to throw in his lot with us,
I think <i>we</i> should be open to the charge of negligence
if we refused his evidence, don&rsquo;t you? Besides,
you can appreciate that he and I are birds of
a feather and must work the same airways. So
losing him, you lose me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stebbins grumblingly changed his tune. &ldquo;Have
it your own way, Mr. Berry. Have it your own
way. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Belknap has valuable material
to contribute&mdash;only the sooner he comes across
with it the better, and safer, for all concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c12">XII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your opinions until they are called for,
man,&rdquo; Belknap said curtly. &ldquo;Or until you know
something of the lay of the land.&rdquo; Swinging on
his heel he made an imperious, inclusive gesture
that swept the room clean of momentarily irrelevant
persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear out of here,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>As the door closed on the retreating group, that
tried to make its exit with dignity, but somehow
failed to convey better than the appearance of
a disorganized partridge brood scuttling into a
thicket, Belknap returned to Berry and the Sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s you and I start from
scratch. I&rsquo;ll concede you that much. I&rsquo;ll throw
down what I&rsquo;ve seen and heard to date. After
that I make no promises.&rdquo; He smiled with a bleak
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
mockery. &ldquo;There are conclusions and conclusions&mdash;<i>and</i>
conclusions. And what I may make of a
given detail may differ widely from what you make
of it. Then again, it may not: &lsquo;great minds,&rsquo; they
say.&mdash; However that may be, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s make a
girls&rsquo; dormitory of it and hang confidences around
each other&rsquo;s necks. I&rsquo;ve always played, and always
will play, a lone wolf game. I&rsquo;m an Akela or
nothing. So you&rsquo;ll have to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, Belknap, we will. Don&rsquo;t worry
about us.&rdquo; Berry interrupted gently, trying to
conceal a faint embarrassment. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to do
now is to get going, isn&rsquo;t it? Before your friend&rsquo;s
body here has gone cold. Quick, Belknap, snap
into it. Every second may count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap regarded Whittaker with a swift, half-averted
glance, and a spasm of pain twitched the
taut little muscles drawn slantwise across his
square jaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be merciful to him,&rdquo; he said in a lowered
key. &ldquo;Though he doesn&rsquo;t deserve it, I fear,&rdquo; he
added, hardening instantly, as a man does who dislikes
being caught out with an emotion. &ldquo;First of
all, you must know he is largely to blame for the
argument I expect he&rsquo;s having with St. Peter. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
won&rsquo;t waste precious time going into the story
now. It&rsquo;s rather complicated. The point you
need to know for a starter is that he did a sneaking,
low-down thing last night that set the house
completely by its ears, where it still is. Under
cover of reading us a bit of original manuscript to
amuse us, he made it a passage from his Diary that
disclosed&mdash;names withheld, but entirely obvious&mdash;one
of his present guests as an erstwhile murderer.
(Neil Crawford, the man in evening
dress.) What made matters more acute was that
he had claimed, at dinner, that the Diary was on
the eve of being published, real names given, his
own included. I doubt the truth of the claim
somehow. But we can check it. Be that as it
may, there has been no congeniality or conviviality
in our midst for the past eight hours, as you can
well imagine. I had had an inkling there was
trouble in the wind. In fact the Judge had given
me to understand he was out for blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted you to keep an eye on Crawford in
case of&mdash;of reprisals, is that it?&rdquo; Berry, as he
threw out the question, was rapidly taking notes.
He was a methodical man, Berry, and, though he
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
had an excellent memory, refused to depend
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when did the first storm warnings occur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately,&rdquo; Belknap continued, pacing the
room restlessly. &ldquo;And it was right there I somehow
made my first blunder. And having lost the
trail once I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve blundered often. In
fact, as I see it now, I probably made a serious
error even earlier when I let one of the party slip
away without even getting out orders to have his
trail picked up. A man by the name of Milton
Dorn left directly after dinner last night&mdash;though
I&rsquo;m sure his first intention had not been to
leave before morning. Doubtless there&rsquo;s nothing
more in it than that he foresaw bothersome complications;
but he&rsquo;s someone to look up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to get back to what happened after the
old man came clean about this guy Crawford,&rdquo;
Stebbins growled, with a distrust of your famed
detective that was slow to be appeased. &ldquo;What
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap&rsquo;s invulnerable self-complacency affected
Stebbins and Berry in totally dissimilar fashion.
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
It stirred in the Sergeant a confused, stubborn rage,
such as the English peasant feels for the arrogant
huntsman heedlessly taking his fences, even though
the hunter does no actual damage. While Berry,
understanding Belknap&rsquo;s natural pride, and realizing
all that nourished it, only wished that a man
of so great a professional stature should know the
meaning of humility. &ldquo;Perhaps the day will
come,&rdquo; Berry thought in passing, &ldquo;when he will
come a cropper in a case of importance, and, bowing
his head, will bow his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming to that,&rdquo; Belknap was saying.
&ldquo;Forgive my lack of speed and clarity in presenting
the facts. My own thinking leads me astray.
Each item, as I check it for your benefit, gives me
pause to reconsider. To go back: Whittaker read
his Diary. Suddenly, at a bad moment in the
gruesome tale, Crawford gave himself away, if
that were needed, by a call for water and help
from his wife. Apparently she was so bewildered
by the catastrophe that was falling upon the family
she let another catastrophe present itself head over
heels. For she delayed going to her husband long
enough to allow his mistress&mdash;that little red-haired
minx you&rsquo;ve just seen upstairs&mdash;fall about
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
his neck and prove how <i>they</i> stood. <i>Also</i> if proving
was necessary. But it brought Mrs. Crawford
to her senses, and <i>she</i> was knocking Miss Video into
a cocked hat when Colonel Blake seemed to consider
knocking the Judge into one. Then the
lights went out. They <i>would</i>! Well, instead of
going to the Judge&rsquo;s rescue, which I guess is what
I should have done, I spent my time reinstating
the lights. They showed, when they came on,
rather a mess. Whittaker was pretty well floored
by what must have been a blow with intent to kill.
Mrs. Crawford and Miss Video were looking murder
at each other. Crawford appeared about to
die of heart failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who stood where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;foreign lady,&rsquo; as you call her, Sergeant,
was nearest to the Judge. Blake seemed not to
have reached him. Though he may have been on
the spot and retreated. The rest were as they had
been, as far as I can recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh-all-hemlock! Pretty good pickin&rsquo;s,
eh?&rdquo; Stebbins, flushed with excitement, was forgetting
the chip on his shoulder. &ldquo;What next,
Mr. Belknap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little enough for awhile. <i>Too</i> little. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
ominous. There was nothing much <i>I</i> could do,
really. Every one went to bed, or pretended to.
I think they would have gone home, to a man, last
night, but were downright ashamed to suggest it.
Or perhaps they felt, as I did, that with morning
a bad dream might vanish. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the best
excuse I have to offer for not proving much good
in the crises. I assisted Whittaker upstairs, and
suggested he apologize to Crawford and clear the
air. I said he was getting the house into all sorts
of a pickle&mdash;to say nothing of the real danger to
himself. But he was in a mean mood. He had
been ill lately and not himself. I&rsquo;ll tell you about
that later, too. Anyway, he stuck to his guns.
He wasn&rsquo;t badly hurt, though might have been.
A slight head wound that someone will have to
account for along with everything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did <i>he</i> have any ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. We discussed the loss of the Diary.
But that didn&rsquo;t seem to worry him much, either.
I imagine the threat of printing it was merely a
ruse to drive his point more terribly home to Crawford.
Poor Crawford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Crawford!&rdquo; Stebbins snorted. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
you eyes in your head, Belknap? Why, I&rsquo;ve had
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
that dress-suited fellow spotted from the minute I
came in here. I&rsquo;ll have <i>him</i> on toast in a jiffy. A
little rough stuff and he&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loss of the Diary?&rdquo; Berry asked, having
caught up on his notes, and ignoring, as did Belknap,
the fact that Stebbins had spoken. &ldquo;What
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I said. It disappeared during the fracas.
Not that it matters much. I can retail you
enough of what was said of Crawford to see him
convicted hands down, if that&rsquo;s the count we want
to get him on. Somehow, I think it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. And after you all withdrew&mdash;what
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my dear Berry. I was a night-hawk;
more so than usual, though at my best I&rsquo;m up and
about most of the night. Rotten sleeper. Always
was. Possibly the most telling bit of evidence
I picked up during my sleepless walking was
what I&rsquo;m convinced was a glimpse of the departed
Dorn. From an upper window I saw a figure I&rsquo;d
swear was his run along below the terrace wall and
into the shrubbery at the north corner. It moved
with extreme rapidity and a lightness of footing
that made me almost uncertain I saw more than
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
a shadow. But for a twig that snapped as he
vanished I would have let him pass as shadow. I
went immediately down, and around by the opposite
side, with intention of circumventing him,
but, though I remained concealed in a niche of
the north wing for at least half an hour, he never
materialized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was that. Interesting, but not particularly
helpful. Who else did you cross footsteps
with during the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With several. Every one had dragged anchor
and was adrift. Miss Video spent a few moments
in Whittaker&rsquo;s room. I believe he found her there
when he went up. And she seems to have enticed
him to return the visit. For Mr. Prentice, the
young man in negligee, spent most of the night
asleep in Whittaker&rsquo;s room waiting for the absent
to return. <i>He</i> may have had designs on the
Judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the Judge on Miss Video? What about
Crawford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw him. What became of him I
haven&rsquo;t a notion. Probably was the one person
to go quietly to bed, having a wife to see that he
got tucked in. I bumped into Miss Lacey in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
library, quite late. Said she was after a bracer,
and looking for her fianc&eacute;. She&rsquo;s engaged to
young Prentice. And she&rsquo;s Whittaker&rsquo;s niece, as
you doubtless know. I saw her to her room, as
she was in a state of nerves. And, soon after, I
decided the tenseness of the situation had eased,
for the time being at least, and turned my back
on it. But I&rsquo;d hardly entered my room when
Miss Mdevani came on a visit. She was quite incoherent,
but before I could begin to make head
or tail of what about, we picked up the first death
broadcast. Mrs. Crawford had found the Colonel.
Says <i>she</i> was looking for her husband, which leads
one to believe he wasn&rsquo;t in bed after all, as do the
clothes he&rsquo;s wearing. Or else she&rsquo;s trying to cover
<i>her</i> tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think your Miss Mdevani was&mdash;fresh
from the kill, so to speak? Her manner
might suggest it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of it, of course. Who wouldn&rsquo;t?
But&mdash;well, with Miss Video&rsquo;s death, and the
Judge&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve rather discarded her. I feel the three
are the work of one. A woman is seldom a good
wholesale murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted. But she&rsquo;s tarnation clever. Her
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
record isn&rsquo;t savory, as we all know. Though I
admit the motives, such as we have, don&rsquo;t fall her
way. This man Crawford has motive enough for
a couple&mdash;perhaps even the third, for if he wished
to destroy the Diary, as he conceivably would, and
Blake was the first to nab it, Blake might have to
die. Yes, it looks black for Mr. Crawford.
What do you say, Sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feeling exactly. It looks mighty black for
Mr. Crawford. Him that kills once can kill again
and kill easier. Come on: let&rsquo;s catch him cold before
he clears out. And before there&rsquo;s any more
shooting. One, two, three murders&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c13">XIII</h2>
<p>The words were scarcely spoken when the air
was again split by gunfire. A very sharp report
came from somewhere: the yard, the basement, or
the servant&rsquo;s wing. It acted as a signal for a pell-mell
return of the others from library to dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that was in the kitchen,&rdquo; Julian, who led the
re-entry by a yard, said with solemn severity, &ldquo;it
looks to me as if they&rsquo;d invaded neutral territory
and something <i>should</i> be done about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Stebbins, who seemed to have a keener
ear for direction, hurriedly threw up the window
on the view, and shouted in the stentorian accents
of the law:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the shootin&rsquo; all about, idiots?
Haven&rsquo;t you no restraints? What&rsquo;d you see, a
jack-rabbit?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;We wasn&rsquo;t shooting, sir,&rdquo; a distant voice came
up as through a funnel. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody way
back down in under the porch. Guess they fired
accidental-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accidental Hell! Go get &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently there was an attempt to obey his
order to the letter, for it was only a matter of
seconds when, to judge by the firing, a regular
battle was in progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, wait for me!&rdquo; Sergeant Stebbins, bristling
with zealous duty, turned on the room.
&ldquo;You folks stay where you are if you know what&rsquo;s
good for you. I guess we&rsquo;ve grounded him&mdash;and
sooner than I thought by a darned sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorn!&rdquo; Julian exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, it only goes
to show that the first hunch is generally the right
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joel was leaning weakly against the sideboard
and sobbing in little gasping breaths like a spent
runner. She held her head between her hands to
close her ears against the racket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand any more. I can&rsquo;t. Oh, I can&rsquo;t
stand it. Turn that shooting off. Turn it off!&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the radio, darling,&rdquo; Julian said quietly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
putting his arm about her shoulders. &ldquo;Though I
admit it sounds like the Colt Revolver hour or
something. What you think is static is being produced
off stage by the housekeeper and that maid
Lily who are rapidly losing their inhibitions in the
pantry. Listen, dear, I <i>do</i> want to see what&rsquo;s going
on.&rdquo; There was a fresh burst of gunfire. &ldquo;Please
can&rsquo;t I go to the lattice and be a Rowena to your
Ivanhoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go along. Go away. I don&rsquo;t care what
you do. <i>Julian</i>, don&rsquo;t go near that window.
You&rsquo;ll be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Julian had taken her first words at their
face value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of ammunition used and nothing done,&rdquo;
he announced from a daring stand in full view of
the lawn. &ldquo;That man Dorn will have time to dig
himself out under the house and make a dash for
it by the front gate. The sergeant has drawn off
all his men from the western front to cope with
this unexpected offensive; and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s an un-Sound
move. Did you get that one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stop</i> it, Julian! If you&rsquo;re the kind of man
that can pun at such a moment as this you aren&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
fit to marry. And I never <i>will</i> marry you&mdash;never,
never,&mdash;<i>Come</i> away from that window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, the firing&rsquo;s all in the wrong direction
so far. The police are waiting to see the
whites of their eyes. And that&rsquo;s going to need
television, considering where the enemy is in hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Stebbins apparently thought so too.
The disturbance came from under the porch of the
servants&rsquo; wing, and from the floor of the porch to
the ground, a drop of eight or ten feet, a fine-meshed
lattice enclosed a garden tool-room and
formed a walled passage to the basement. Its outside
door was closed, undoubtedly barricaded.
Stebbins had tried the basement approach and
found it closed and sealed. But he had decided on
squeezing tactics. Two of his men, stationed in
the cellar, were to burst through the inner door
at the moment of a supporting attack from the
yard.</p>
<p>Without warning Sergeant Stebbins gave his two-shot
signal. And the din was on. Julian, really
pale, stepped back and held his hand across his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shiver my timbers!&rdquo; he said, with a deep,
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
trembling shudder. &ldquo;God help whoever it is. He
has pluck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smell of gunpowder had sifted into the
room. Underfoot the sounds of the splintering
door were somehow more affecting than the actual
shots. The tensity and misery of the five in the
dining-room were reaching an unbearable pitch.
The loss of the restraining influence, though not a
happy restraint, of Belknap and Berry, who had
gone to the front as staff officers, was tending to
break down such morale as had existed. Joel was
moaning as if she had been wounded. Sydney
Crawford, with staring eyes, was gripping Neil&rsquo;s
arm between her two hands until every knuckle
showed white. Neil was shivering from head to
foot as a man shivers after too long a swim in cold
water.</p>
<p>Suddenly it was the silence, crashing back into
place, that seemed deafening, like lightning-cut
cloud meeting in thunder. In it, Nadia Mdevani,
who had appeared to be holding her nerve, lost it.
She pointed, as if at blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! In the name of Christ, look there.
There&rsquo;s what spelled Bertrand Whittaker&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a figure eight in the form of two overlapping
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
holes bored in the paneling of the wall at
the height of a man&rsquo;s head. Freshly cut: there was
a faint salting of sawdust on the hardwood floor
beneath.</p>
<p>It took Joel to break the stillness in the room.
With a face like a death-mask she gazed at the dark
spot on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know who killed
Colonel Blake and Romany and Uncle Bertrand.
But it can&rsquo;t be true. It can&rsquo;t be true that&mdash;&rdquo;
Julian didn&rsquo;t let her finish. He crushed his hand
over her mouth as Belknap came in from the butler&rsquo;s
pantry, with the sergeant and Berry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! you little fool. Don&rsquo;t go saying things.
Don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> be responsible for hanging somebody.
Let Mr. Belknap take care of that.&rdquo; He shook her
desperately. &ldquo;Whatever you know or think, keep
it to yourself, do you hear? <i>Do</i> you? Don&rsquo;t let
&rsquo;em get it out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Belknap had heard enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this you know, Miss Joel?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Come now, out with it. No, don&rsquo;t cry like that.
I&rsquo;m sorry. What&rsquo;s the trouble, Miss Mdevani?&rdquo;
He turned to Nadia as Joel collapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have been barred from detective
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
work on account of your eyes,&rdquo; Nadia said.
&ldquo;Look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha-a-a? So that&rsquo;s the way the wind blows?
We&rsquo;ll investigate directly. We have another matter
to deal with right now. All right, Sergeant,
there&rsquo;s your man.&rdquo; He indicated Crawford.</p>
<p>Stebbins went to Crawford and touched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I place you under arrest, Mr. Crawford, charged
with instigating the murder of Judge Whittaker.
Your hired accomplices have confessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crawford looked dazed. Then he swung on
Stebbins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have <i>not</i> confessed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For they
did not kill Whittaker. If this is what is meant
by third degree, you can do your damnedest. They
are as innocent of this crime as you are. You can
do your worst to me; but not to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst has been done to them I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;
Berry said quietly. &ldquo;They are both dead. They
told us to tell you the account is squared. Whatever
that may mean. So I guess you have to go
along with us. That gives us <i>one</i> of our men,
Sergeant. Now what&rsquo;s this hole-in-the-wall business,
Belknap? Neat work on your part, Crawford?
You had things ready for business, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some entrance to the space between
the wall and the tapestry of the library,&rdquo;
Belknap said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better call John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John came. He showed them a thin door within
a door&mdash;a long, narrow, hinged panel that formed
a door jamb in the dining-room-library doorway.
Belknap went through it. No one spoke. When
he returned he carried a Colt twenty-two in his
handkerchief. He went directly to Nadia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would offer you this back,&rdquo; he said in a low
voice, &ldquo;but we shall need it. I&rsquo;m truly sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry in the least.&rdquo; She looked him
straight in the eyes. &ldquo;It is mine, yes. I missed it
when <i>I</i> needed it last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c14">XIV</h2>
<p>Late in the afternoon a &lsquo;London&rsquo; fog had crept
up from the Sound, and smothered in its furry,
suffocating waves, Thorngate was sinking into
depth below depth of depression. Julian asked
weren&rsquo;t there seven levels of Purgatory because if
so they must be about six down at five o&rsquo;clock and
rapidly approaching the bottom. It was the total
lack of headway made by the investigators, and the
apparent helplessness of the law, that tripled and
quadrupled the early gloom of the second night.
Hours upon hours of questioning and cross-questioning
by Stebbins, Belknap and Berry in turn had
gathered no really tangible results. Yet the steady,
unremittent grilling went on&mdash;and on and on and
on, as Julian said, like the tail of Christopher
Robin&rsquo;s mouse.</p>
<p>Julian was unquenchable. During his own brief
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
appearance in the witness box&mdash;an uncomfortable,
straight-backed chair at one side of the dining-room
table, the dining-room being the temporary seat of
legal authority&mdash;he had played a combination of
clown and dunce, to the rage of Stebbins, the scorn
of Belknap, and the amusement of Berry. For
Julian had at last made up his mind to throw in his
lot, and his clues, with Berry&rsquo;s, as soon as he could
isolate Berry. And it was for this he was managing
to keep his own counsel. He wasn&rsquo;t casting bread
on the troubled waters for that Savonarola Belknap,
or Stebbins, to pick up and grow fat upon. But
he <i>did</i> feel that he perhaps shouldn&rsquo;t rate a whole
investigation to himself, seeing it was his first. It
would be positively presumptuous to suppose he
had a chance to make a coup (not that he didn&rsquo;t
suppose it just the same) against such a field of
stars. Belknap might even be called a first magnitude.</p>
<p>So when Stebbins was severe with him, chronically
severe, he took refuge in an india-rubber
persiflage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Mdevani saw you on the stairs at 4:30
<span class="sc">A.M.</span> What did you say you were doing about
that time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;I swear I was doing nothing whatever about it.
Time is one of those things you save time by leaving
to its own devices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stebbins huffed and he puffed; Belknap cleared
his throat; Berry smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said what were you doing in the hall at 4:30
<span class="sc">A.M.</span>?&rdquo; Stebbins&rsquo; voice did all the things Stebbins
would have enjoyed doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had put my shoes out at 11 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, and I
thought they might be back by four.&rdquo; Julian was
examining the end of his tie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contempt of court, Julian,&rdquo; Belknap said.
&ldquo;Come now, boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave him to me,&rdquo; Stebbins thundered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking to him, Mr. Belknap. Now, Mr.
Prentice, will you repeat that again about you and
Miss Lacey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others must be tired of hearing it; but if
you want it, I&rsquo;m never tired of saying it.&rdquo; Julian
struck a sentimental attitude. &ldquo;I love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stebbins blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you what went on in your room&mdash;I
mean what was Miss Lacey doing in your&mdash;I
mean&mdash; Oh, get to Hell out of here. I&rsquo;ll call
you again when I need you. Bring in Crawford.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&lsquo;Bring in Crawford!&rsquo; All afternoon the word
had periodically come out: &lsquo;Bring in Crawford,&rsquo;
and at each call Crawford, more shattered, more
bewildered, more desperately ill with weariness and
anguish, was led in, only to come out again to a
stark and tragic Sydney who, between rounds as it
were, tried mechanically to warm his hands with
her colder hands.</p>
<p>Stebbins decidedly had it in for Crawford. Naturally
he was prejudiced by a nasty little battle
that had left him two badly wounded men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was Judge Whittaker&rsquo;s Diary to you?
You needn&rsquo;t answer. I know. And we&rsquo;ll get you
for that anyway. Where is the Diary now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Answer</i> me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you killed Blake to get it what did you
do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing at 3 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was down at the Turnpike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After killing Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I didn&rsquo;t kill Blake;&rdquo; with infinite
weariness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Were you in Miss Video&rsquo;s room at 2:30?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She was with someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I heard voices and didn&rsquo;t
knock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>did</i> you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw to the basement door for admitting my
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking time to dispose of Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your wife know of your relationship with
Miss Video?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you quarrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you suggest putting Miss Video out of the
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Bertrand Whittaker&rsquo;s life or
mine&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. I have not denied my intention to kill
Whittaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you admit your men to the house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were never in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are these the gloves with which you filched Miss
Mdevani&rsquo;s pistol and handled the paper knife against
Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on, over and over, with Crawford&rsquo;s voice
dull and monotonous. But driven and hounded as
he was he never yielded a point beyond his admission
of an old murder and an intended one. But,
as Stebbins said to Berry, it was merely a matter
of time before they had a full confession from
Crawford: he was the kind that eventually succumbs
to third degree methods. And Stebbins was
the one man sure of the way the wind blew!</p>
<p>He treated Nadia on the other hand with due
respect, as they did all three. Stebbins obviously
feared her. Berry sat gazing at her, spellbound.
Belknap looked anywhere but at her, paced the
floor, threw spokes in the wheels of Stebbins&rsquo; questionnaire,
and put up defences that, in his blindness
to them, he apparently thought were as invisible
to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your handkerchief, Miss Mdevani?&rdquo; Stebbins
produced the handkerchief found by Belknap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;That handkerchief,&rdquo; Belknap interposed impatiently,
&ldquo;was on the library floor when I helped
Whittaker to his room at 11:30.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first we have heard of it,&rdquo; Stebbins
snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea when I dropped it,&rdquo;
Nadia went on, ignoring the interruption. &ldquo;Possibly
it was when I found Blake, about 4:30.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You found Blake?</i>&rdquo; Stebbins pounced on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t you notify someone immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was scarcely time. Mrs. Crawford did it
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you when Mrs. Crawford
screamed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Mr. Belknap&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had gone to tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you heard anything on <i>your</i> rounds? The
way trails <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> cross last night beats everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that rat in the library walls&mdash;you recall
my mentioning him, Mr. Belknap? His teeth
turn out to have been a tool called a gimlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your pistol?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you have it last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on my dresser when I came down to
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a permit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. I have carried a weapon for years. A
lone lady, you know,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you leave it on your dresser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had taken it from my handbag when I was
fishing for my lipstick. I neglected to return it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap stood directly in front of her, his hands
thrust deep in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it there myself not later than one-thirty,
or two. Your window was open to the balcony.
It was when I went to close it that I saw the figure
on the terrace which I am willing to swear was that
of Dorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are forever ringing your Milton Dorn in
on this, Belknap. For God&rsquo;s sake produce him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My scouts are out,&rdquo; Belknap said with suave
contempt. &ldquo;The report comes that he never has
returned to town. So far, so good. I think if you
would dwell a moment on this phase of the case
you would find the house bore me out in saying
Dorn left here last night in a strange state of perturbation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
He looked like a man about to lose
sane control of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you make a good point, Belknap,&rdquo;
Berry spoke. &ldquo;In many ways the whole campaign
has the earmarks of the inspired scheme of a maniac,
conceived and executed with that type of
brilliance. We must at least leave no stone unturned
in the hunt for Dorn. That&rsquo;s enough of
you for the present, Miss Mdevani. Now let&rsquo;s
have a crack at Miss Lacey, Sergeant. In a moment&mdash;time
out for drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a terrified and incoherent Joel that
faced her three interlocutors&mdash;more terrified than
seemed quite called for under the circumstances,
bad as the circumstances were. Horror was to be
expected, and fear of a sort perhaps, but not stark
terror. But Joel was the victim of a terror that
alternated moments of intense shivering with a rigid
paralysis of movement. She bravely tried to control
herself, and sat sipping the brandy Belknap
had poured for her and smiling mechanically.
Berry was extremely kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell us, Miss Lacey, as clearly and consecutively
as possible, the story of your night last
night? There is no slightest wish on our part to
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
hurry or confuse you. We need your help in settling
an affair that <i>has</i> been tragic and is likely to
be more so unless we do something about it. Will
you describe to us the way you spent your time between
10:30 last night, when I understand you retired,
until 4:30 this morning when Colonel Blake&rsquo;s
murder was discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joel, in broken snatches, told them of how she
had gone to her room in a perturbed state of
mind&mdash;puzzled by her uncle, bewildered at the
startling rapidity with which a dangerous situation
had fallen out of the blue, and inwardly shaken
by a tale of murder that had struck home to one
of their own number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the fact that your uncle read a passage of
this Diary relative to a crime actually committed
by Mr. Crawford mean that he might equally well
have touched on crimes of others present? Or do
you think he was choosing this way to cruelly pay
off a score against Crawford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joel drew a deep breath and looked quickly at
Belknap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must have been a personal question
between my uncle and Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; she said
firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Belknap appeared deaf to question and answer.
Joel shuddered a little and dropped her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Lacey. There seems to be
mutual agreement on that point. You went to
your room, you say. What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had prepared for bed slowly, for there was
no hope of sleep and she wished to fill the time.
She had stood at the window, walked the floor, sat
by the fire. She thought, and thought; about shoes
and ships and sealing wax, but about sin in particular,
and finally about sin in the abstract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Stebbins curtly. He had been
bothered by the way all his witnesses were inclined
to wander off the beaten track into philosophizing
and psychologizing. &ldquo;Go on with the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the idea of going directly to her uncle had
occurred to her. At least she might find out why
he was in this cold, bleak, inhuman mood. It
might be he was facing a dilemma that was slowly
but surely cornering him. Put in a corner for
badness Bertrand Whittaker always went from bad
to worse. This was worse.</p>
<p>She had crept out and along the hall&mdash;last
night&rsquo;s atmosphere had called for creeping&mdash;and
was about to tap on her uncle&rsquo;s door when she
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
heard voices within: her uncle&rsquo;s and Romany&rsquo;s.
Joel turned swiftly and slipped into a darkened
doorway; and Romany had made her exit with a
last dramatic fling over her shoulder. &ldquo;All right,
Bertrand, I&rsquo;ll match you revelation for revelation if
that&rsquo;s your game. There are several of you due for
a fall if I let so-and-so out of the bag. And I&rsquo;m
going to let her out.&rdquo; Joel had caught so-and-so&rsquo;s
name and promptly lost it again in the frightful
medley of subsequent events. She hoped it would
come back. It was troubling her with a feeling of
its vague familiarity.</p>
<p>Romany had disappeared, and no longer wanting
a scene with her uncle, Joel had returned to her
room and knocked on Julian&rsquo;s door to ask for comfort
and sympathy. She and Julian had discussed
pros and cons, thises and thats, until Julian felt it
was his turn to try to pour oil on Whittaker. He
had left her sitting alone and desolate&mdash;promising
a quick return; but he had never come back.</p>
<p>And very late, feeling badly in need of a bracer,
she had summoned the courage to venture down
to the tray of liquors in the library.</p>
<p>Here Joel paused in her slow, hesitant narration
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
and trembled uncontrollably from head to foot like
a spent runner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s troubling you, Miss Lacey?&rdquo; Berry
asked gently. &ldquo;Did something happen in the library?
Come now, what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing happened exactly. I&rsquo;m easily
frightened I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed unable to answer, and turned an appealing
glance toward Belknap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came in from the dining room when Miss
Lacey was there,&rdquo; Belknap said in a low voice,
holding Joel steady with his eyes. &ldquo;She was hysterical
and overwrought, but it hardly seemed
surprising considering the general tension of the
household. It appears I was wrong. Can&rsquo;t you
tell us what upset you, Joel dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;came in from the dining-room,&rdquo; she
whispered, her face colorless. &ldquo;I was tired and
nervous, that&rsquo;s all. You startled me dreadfully.
Nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure, Miss Lacey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely sure. Of course. Mr. Belknap was
so kind as to see me to my room. I was doing my
best to fall asleep when Mrs. Crawford screamed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>This was the most they could win from her&mdash;even
when Stebbins insisted on a turn of the screw.
She became stony and expressionless under pressure
and they dared not urge her for the time being,
though they felt she was decidedly withholding
something of real importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go and try once more for a little
sleep, Miss Lacey,&rdquo; Berry said. &ldquo;We all need it,&rdquo;
he added with a weary sigh. &ldquo;What do you say
we call it a day, boys? Can I have a word with
you, Belknap? <i>What</i> a fog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap had been unable to guess which way the
cat was jumping as far as Berry was concerned.
He had not shown his hand in the least; and as for
his face it was the perfect detective face, charming
but expressionless, bland and open, but with as
much depth as a plaster cast. It was only, as Julian
remarked to Joel outside, when you took the trouble
to meet his eyes squarely that you positively jumped,
as if you had caught the eyes of your ancestral
great-great-great somebody-or-other rolling at you
from the wall. A secret chamber, and holes where
the canvas should be! In Berry&rsquo;s case that must
mean something&mdash;if nothing more than that he
was seeing more than he let on. It was certainly
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
one of the first reasons why Julian was intending to
take matters up with him alone.</p>
<p>Berry had so far only shown an interest in funny
little irrelevant, or seemingly irrelevant, details.
His total contribution to the afternoon&rsquo;s entertainment
had been sudden pesky interruptions, at inopportune
moments, when he insisted upon shelving
the important point at issue for the sake of what
was a minor matter to Belknap and a very, very
minor one to Stebbins. Stebbins saw things in
black and white. Belknap was more willing to
consider the shadings, but he had had to admit that
a great many of Berry&rsquo;s nuances escaped him.
Berry&rsquo;s &ldquo;pardon-me&rdquo; was a vague murmur about
an Achilles heel&mdash;that one never knew in what out
of the way spot the weakness might turn up. Best
to probe them all with your spear thrust.</p>
<p>For instance, there was the sprinkling of the few
dried carnation petals fallen across Romany&rsquo;s rumpled
hair and pillow&mdash;Stebbins had them now in a
cup at his elbow, somehow pathetic, as if they had
been her ashes. Romany, as she was discovered by
Lily, and later examined by Berry and Stebbins,
was a little heap of pink maribou dressing gown on
her bed&mdash;her face ivory white under her amber
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
hair&mdash;theatrical and unreal: &ldquo;Call it <i>La Mort du
Cygne</i>, or, better still, <i>She Who Gets Slapped</i>,&rdquo;
Julian had said, standing in the doorway of her
room that morning. She had apparently been unexpectedly
seized and held firmly, there was little
sign of struggle, by two hands, with the thumbs
pressing deeply at the base of the throat where
there was a faint congestion and discoloration.
There was only the one material clue: the carnation
petals. And that seemed immaterial, since there
was a bowl of carnations on the bedside table, which
made it more than likely she had been holding one
for its scent. Or was it possible the murderer had
his sentimental moments!</p>
<p>But Berry made harpstrings of those petals and
played on them in and out of season. Had anyone
worn a lapel flower the evening before? Everyone
was agreed that Dorn was wearing one&mdash;but
they were equally agreed it was a gardenia. Belknap
himself was positive on this point, although
some of the others lost their certainty. Belknap
also said <i>he</i> might have been wearing one himself;
he exchanged glances with Nadia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you offer me a flower for my buttonhole,
Miss Mdevani,&rdquo; he said in a gently bantering
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
tone, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let anyone&rsquo;s presence deter you. I
should be charmed to have one from your fair
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be freshly plucked,&rdquo; she answered him,
her eyes very bright, high color on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No innuendoes!&rdquo; Berry had cried. &ldquo;You two
need a moor and a moon. Remember this is a
court of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not likely to forget it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But,
dangerous as it is to me, the moor and the moon
would be more so,&rdquo; and she tilted her chin at
Belknap.</p>
<p>This had been a temporary fade-out of Berry&rsquo;s
interest in the carnation. But he had returned to
it often, as he had to other apparently illogical and
tiresomely remote incidents. It had the effect,
however, of whetting Belknap&rsquo;s appetite for enlightenment:
had Berry a theory, or no theory; was
he throwing dust to cover what he considered the
crux of the whole business, or was he merely floundering
in a waste of motives, unable to take the bull
by the horns? Certainly it was time the two of
them went into a huddle and exchanged views, even
if the views were limited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>So it was with great expectations that Belknap
answered Berry&rsquo;s proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s go into retreat. I have a little to say
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2 id="c15">XV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Nadia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Belknap! God rest you merry gentleman!&rdquo;
Belknap had approached Nadia where she
stood alone, in an alcove of the great East Room.
She had been trying to concentrate on a specimen
of modern French art. The fog pressed a whited
face against the windows near her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mood is a difficult one, Nadia. I want to
talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let nothing you dismay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap threw out his hands in a helpless gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not kind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall we go outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>thank</i> you. Remember your Mr. Dorn.&rdquo;
Her dim smile, secretive, came and went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, what would you have had me do?
Tell them about the code&mdash;or have you conveniently
forgotten the message? By the way, did I
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
give it back to you? I haven&rsquo;t been able to find
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She whirled on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you destroy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. I can&rsquo;t remember. Mrs. Crawford
rather upset our t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nadia looked him critically, menacingly, up and
down from chin to brow and brow to chin. Her
nostrils quivered; her cheeks sucked in; her eyes
narrowed to shining cracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are moments when I suspect you of double
dealing, Detective. You may be out to get me
after all, and are finding the back-handed method
the cleverest. (<i>Damn</i> the O&rsquo;Neill reiteration of
that fog horn!)&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash he saw the single frayed thread by
which she held her nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true, Nadia, and you know it.&rdquo;
Belknap returned her look with one as piercing and
equally cruel in its way. &ldquo;Guilty or not, it&rsquo;s all
one to me. But I <i>am</i> out to get you. Yes, I want
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her look was filmed with another, a softer one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;want me. What does that mean? Is
&lsquo;want&rsquo; the word you intend?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>He admired her frankness; though he hated the
woman of it, that must always have the facts sugar-coated.
He was hard to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the word I meant. Want. Are you
suggesting that overnight it should or could be anything
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave an odd little sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; she said with a faint shrug of her
lovely shoulders. &ldquo;Only there is so much want and
so little&mdash;of the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. My impression is we wouldn&rsquo;t need
much of the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t touch her, they were both being
hurt by the desire to touch. She flinched a
little before the brutal magnetism of his eyes. She
felt gutted by them as by a fire; and shuddered her
whole body to shake herself free, as a dog shudders
rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t talk of it now,&rdquo; she said restlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take advantage of the time that remains
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning by that that my hours are numbered?&rdquo;
She threw him a quick sidewise glance
under a curve of her lashes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <i>truly</i>
think your studied lack of interest in me will get
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
me off? Really, that&rsquo;s altogether too modest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are unfair, my dear. I am doing my best
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on. Say it: &lsquo;without belief.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belief! Belief in what? Your innocence?
God in His heaven, you didn&rsquo;t imagine your love
potion as strong as all that, did you? Let&rsquo;s be
honest. We can afford to be, you and I. It takes
courage, but courage is the coin of our particular
realm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is to be honest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of us, beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you crave, I suppose, is a full confession,
brief and to the point, omitting details. Mr. Belknap,
I could almost think you are making love
to me (oh, using the word lightly, don&rsquo;t be
alarmed!) to acquire information to be used against
me. It may be you are regretting your gestures in
my favor. Are you worrying about the reputation
of Detective Ordway Belknap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly so late in the day. It&rsquo;s been already
thrown to the dogs. I have an intense distaste
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
for attitudes or I should say I had thrown it at your
feet, cold heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so cold as you might think perhaps,&rdquo; and
there was a tremor below the voice. &ldquo;I seldom
meet a man I feel is my match or better. I had
hopes of you. You disappoint me.&rdquo; The acrimony
crept back. &ldquo;To give me to understand
that you pass up a brilliant display of your methods
when you fail to put your finger on me doesn&rsquo;t
speak well for yourself, John. Even Sergeant Stebbins
admits I&rsquo;m too easy to be right.&rdquo; She had the
audacity to look mischievous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stebbins be damned. It&rsquo;s just his bull-headed
sort than can&rsquo;t see the obvious for dust. Nadia,
you&rsquo;re beating around the bush most successfully,
but though I like to hear you play with words let&rsquo;s
clear the decks. And then my congratulations.
Three in an evening is a jolly good bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Belknap,&rdquo; she said with a sudden hard
seriousness, &ldquo;I have killed no one at Thorngate&mdash;neither
Blake, nor Romany, nor my beloved Bertrand.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Desperate
as my case may look the fight isn&rsquo;t over yet.
It&rsquo;s just begun. I expect to produce a murderer
to take my place, and I believe I have my man,
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
using the word to cover the female of the species,
under surveillance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confide in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o-o, I think not. Finder&rsquo;s keeper&rsquo;s, until&mdash;oh
well, until.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap&rsquo;s dark face darkened another shade.
Even <i>his</i> control was wearing as sharp and thin
as an edged tool. This futile fencing with Nadia
Mdevani, taken with the savage unaccountable
ache she stirred in him, was trying his last ounce of
endurance. Yet there seemed to be no other way
with her unless it were to eat humble pie; and be
damned if he&rsquo;d bend his nature for any woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Miss Lacey appear to know it all.&rdquo;
His tone harbored scorn at the root of its being.
&ldquo;I should say it was about time you did something
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nadia looked serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> something troubling Joel Lacey,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;But she is keeping it well to herself, in
spite of you and that Sergeant Stebbins; and even
me. For I&rsquo;ve been hot on her trail. I should say
it was loss of nerve and not lack of knowledge that
is holding her tongue-tied. Perhaps she&rsquo;d <i>better</i>
let well enough alone. Do you know, dear man,
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
there are times when terror rises in me like a cold
fountain. Not that I&rsquo;m afraid of death exactly;
but I don&rsquo;t relish it just around every corner. Did
you see &lsquo;Outward Bound&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much. Only those blind ships blowing
down there in the fog reminded me of it.
Who will be next, Mr. Belknap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take it for granted there <i>will</i> be a next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; her eyes were steady on his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps it is my duty to see you under
lock and key. You don&rsquo;t go so far as to deny I
could command your arrest, do you? There is
that Berlin-Viennese Murder Ring to account for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know too much,&rdquo; she murmured with serpent
softness. &ldquo;Did Bertrand <i>tell</i> you more than
he knew? Or did he write it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what you care to have it mean.&rdquo; She
paused. &ldquo;Are you asking for it&mdash;my arrest?&rdquo;
There was no slightest trace of apprehension in her
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not exactly. I&rsquo;m asking for something
far more necessary to my peace of mind.&rdquo; He
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
took her wrists suddenly and drew her towards
him. &ldquo;Kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She twisted her hands free and turned away.
But her lips were drawn a little, and her face very
white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s in it I
know, and Bertrand Whittaker. Possibly Cain,
Orestes, Brutus, Hamlet&rsquo;s mother and a few besides.
But let&rsquo;s keep Judas out of it if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<h2 id="c16">XVI</h2>
<p>Stebbins had departed. Headquarters needed
him. And he had gone, warding off with both
arms a hornet&rsquo;s nest of reporters all down the drive
to his parked car. He said he&rsquo;d be back if he was
wanted, or something turned up in the way of
evidence. For all the help he was he might as well
stay away, Julian said, but perhaps he was good
camouflage. The house did somehow feel a little
more exposed without him; although he left a substantial
guard.</p>
<p>There was a tense, uncomfortable, haphazard
meal in the nature of a buffet supper. The
kitchen was so disorganized it was a miracle anything
like food came out of it. No one was on the
best of speaking terms with anyone else&mdash;unless
perhaps Julian with Joel, and she was too distressed
with weariness and fear to know what he
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
was saying. So he had resigned himself to sitting
near her where she lay on the library divan, her
tear-darkened lids closed over her tired eyes. He
tried to figure rhyme or reason into the events of
the twenty-four hours. He traced patterns and
followed clues to where they disappeared in storm
and mist. He tried flying below the clouds, tried
to get above them, and failed to make it either
way. For all he knew he was flying upside down.
And yet his mind seemed lucid, even brilliant. It
was extraordinary how nearness to Joel had the
power to heighten and stimulate whatever he was
doing, talking, thinking, feeling, dreaming. If
she now and then failed to catch his innuendoes,
the stupid darling, yet it was her very presence
that made him even half-way witty. And, if she
didn&rsquo;t quite understand music as he understood it,
it was her closeness to his shoulder at a concert
that lifted him beyond the appreciative to the
creative listener. He leaned over now and kissed
her cheek gently, not to disturb her.</p>
<p>He very much wished she would tell him what
had been so upsetting her since she had seen that
black figure eight in the wainscoting. Not that
it wasn&rsquo;t a strangely sinister and upsetting discovery&mdash;even
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
Julian couldn&rsquo;t control a shudder at the
thought of it. But Joel&rsquo;s upset condition had been
chronic. It was just because she claimed it would
upset her more to talk of it than to try to forget
it (oh, if she only <i>could</i> forget it!) that he had
decided not to urge her. Besides, she had said it
was all a frightful nightmare, utterly impossible
and false. She must, simply <i>must</i>, put it out of
mind.</p>
<p>Julian, though, had been having a few weird and
outrageous ideas himself; and he would have liked
nothing better than to compare notes with Joel.
Dorn was troubling him like a ghost or a vampire.
The least stir of the curtains, the quietest footstep,
went through his body with a needle-thrust of exquisite
horror. Perhaps Belknap had not been
alone in having a fleeting glimpse of the man&mdash;if
man he still was. To Julian to be insane was to be
inhuman. Something <i>had</i> happened when Joel
was in the library, Julian felt convinced of that.
By signs of a strained understanding between her
and Belknap he came to the conclusion they both
knew what it was. He could almost have said they
shared a guilty secret, as if they were shielding
someone, against the rules of the game. Why in
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
the name of heaven should they shield Dorn?
He might have been a friend of Whittaker&rsquo;s, but as
far as Julian knew Joel had scarcely met him; and
Belknap, the night before, had shown a positive
dislike for him.</p>
<p>It might be Mrs. Crawford they were combining
to protect. There seemed to be an all-around
conspiracy to spare Sydney. Well, who could
wonder, really? After Whittaker&rsquo;s unspeakable
betrayal, and Neil&rsquo;s and Romany&rsquo;s, and the thought
of the Diary with its ghastly story ever appearing
in print, who could blame her for getting her hands
on the Diary if it meant Hartley Blake&rsquo;s life&mdash;for
revenging her honor if it meant Romany&rsquo;s life&mdash;or
her husband&rsquo;s honor if it meant Whittaker&rsquo;s?
Or perhaps Belknap and Berry were closing in on
Sydney obliquely, by way of pressure brought to
bear on Neil. <i>That</i> might break her to admission.
Although the way she looked tonight, coming and
going from the room where Neil lay ill and delirious,
nothing short of death would break her.</p>
<p>They had been hard on Neil Crawford&mdash;unnecessarily
so, Julian thought. Though even if
someone had been ahead of his assassins in the case
of Whittaker, as Crawford insisted, he supposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
the law could do something about the mere fact of
intended murder. And Crawford, as well as his
wife, had reasons for wishing Romany and the
Diary disposed of. When it came right down to it
any one of them might have killed Whittaker.
But how thankful one was, Julian drew a deep
breath, to have it done for him. He even wondered
if there mightn&rsquo;t now be a chance for some
of them to wiggle out scot-free&mdash;with the past
still a closed book. One thing about Belknap he
had to admit was jolly decent&mdash;and that was his
not stressing what must have been as obvious to
him as to the others, perhaps more obvious: namely,
that Whittaker&rsquo;s intention had been to make a
clean sweep of his guests. Not only was Belknap
being discreet with regard to the content of the
Diary, but he was actually soft-pedaling it. No
doubt wholly in consideration of Nadia Mdevani
as usual! But in this instance he was benefiting
others than Nadia. And Julian for one was
deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Again, who had killed whom? Who had chased
whom around the walls of what? However you
looked at it any one could have killed every other
one. And quite possibly victim could have killed
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
victim&mdash;perhaps two-thirds of the murderers
were among the murdered. Which could lead to
conjuring in terms: victor-victim, or victim-victor.
Blake may have killed Romany, Romany
Blake. Even the doctor was unable to tell which
had died first&mdash;the times had apparently so nearly
coincided. Or Whittaker could have killed both.
The one proven fact was that neither Blake
nor Romany could have killed Whittaker. It was
hoped there would be one more fact settled with
the matching of markings on the bullet and pistol.
<i>The</i> bullet. Julian was still bothered by the question
of his two shots. One must have been an
echo.</p>
<p>And <i>had</i> Nadia Mdevani fired her own weapon?
She had been found in the library&mdash;its only occupant.
But she gave the appearance of not having
stirred for hours. Perfect acting. But it would
take superhuman agility to have cleared the wall-space
and become rooted to the couch before he
had sprung in from the terrace outside. And
why had she left her gun lying around? Perhaps
she thought nothing would be discovered before
she returned in quiet to dispose of it. No, that
wouldn&rsquo;t do: she herself had spotted the holes.
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
The margin between being innocently honest and
too honest because of guilt is so slight it would
take a wiser and more practiced analyst than Julian
considered himself to be to gauge it. Here again
he had hope of Berry. And it was clear Berry was
not particularly inclined to Nadia&rsquo;s guilt. He
seemed to have other fish to fry. What fish?</p>
<p>For if Nadia, Sydney and Crawford, by a bare
chance, were all innocent, who was left? Joel,
himself,&mdash;and of course that mysterious Dorn.
Why couldn&rsquo;t they find Dorn? Talk about the
ineffectiveness of the police! The one thing
you&rsquo;d think they might accomplish would be the
finding of a human being who had had less than
twelve hours&rsquo; start. Particularly if he was, as
began to seem more than likely, hanging around
Thorngate. If it wasn&rsquo;t for this blasted fog he&rsquo;d
go hunting himself, even if it meant a hand-to-hand
encounter. Anything was better than waiting
for Dorn to move. What was that noise now&mdash;like
a finger-nail on glass? A twig rubbed on
the window by the wind? But there wasn&rsquo;t a
wind. Wind and fog don&rsquo;t go hand in hand.
The thing to do was to find Berry and get down to
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
work. It was this terrible inactivity that was beginning
to tell on his nerves.</p>
<p>He hated to leave Joel, even for a moment.
Looking at her sad, white face as she lay there
sleeping (she had fallen into a restless sleep) his
heart ached for her. Forgive her her murder!
He had scarcely thought of it since she had told
him of it. He would protect her against the past
as well as against the future. He prayed the future
had nothing worse in store for her. He
touched her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>will</i> come back soon this time, my darling,&rdquo;
he whispered.</p>
<p>Joel stirred, shifted. Her lips moved, though
her eyes were closed. She whispered something,
and Julian bent down quickly to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violet Mowbray, that&rsquo;s the name. You see
I <i>did</i> remember. Violet&mdash;Violet&mdash;Violet&mdash;&rdquo;
She trailed off into indistinguishable sounds.</p>
<p>Julian waited, hoping she might, while she was
about this opportune sleep-talking, give away more
important matters. But she didn&rsquo;t speak again,
and Julian, pleased as Punch anyway with what she
had revealed, went off to find Berry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c17">XVII</h2>
<p>Then, very suddenly, Joel woke up. She came
wide, staring wide, awake. The library was
dark. It hadn&rsquo;t been dark when she fell asleep.
<i>Something</i> had waked her. Was it the snapping
of the electric switch? Was it the closing of a
door&mdash;the door must be shut for there wasn&rsquo;t
a glimmer of light? Was it the Presence by its
mere presence? For there <i>was</i> a Presence. As
sure as death there was Someone in the room with
her. She could almost, her nerves were so tense,
so painfully sensitive, tell exactly at what spot
the Someone was. Her nerves were like the antenn&aelig;
of a beetle or the searchlight rays of a battleship,
reaching out and feeling It somewhere between
her and the terrace windows. She couldn&rsquo;t
move her eyeballs in that direction&mdash;not that she
could have seen It if she had. But without hearing
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
It she knew It moved, and without hearing
It she knew It breathed. Her flesh experienced
such a pain of terror that it stung even the
inner membrane of her nostrils, like intense cold,
and brought the tears of intense cold under her
eyelids. If she could scream or move! But she
was incapable of either. Except for the waves of
fear that went over her in pain, her body was detached
and subject to no sweating exertion of the
will. Her brain alone was active, in a strangely
shrunken but vivid way. Like a little cornered
rodent, very small but very much alive, it tore
quivering about in a tiny brightly lighted trap.
It had static, feverish, stricken eyes and it ran up
one side of its cage only to fall back and hysterically
attempt the other. If something would mercifully
happen&mdash;instantaneous death instead of
waiting for it in a condemned cell.</p>
<p>She remembered! How much she remembered,
in flashes, with the clarity of flying bird
shadows on sunlit snow; and in bitter irony
watched herself remembering, realizing it was
what one conventionally did during numbered
seconds. There was that terrible hanging story
of Ambrose Bierce&rsquo;s when you didn&rsquo;t know until
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
the last sentence that the whole action took place
in the man&rsquo;s mind between the tightening of the
noose and the extinction of life. She herself had
had a somewhat similar experience on a bobsled
run on an icy hill that led across a river at the
foot, when it became certain that a skid on a turn
was going to throw them clear of the bridge into
the gorge. Her soul had deserted the doomed ship
and calmly watched the end of her body. That
she lived through it wasn&rsquo;t by her soul&rsquo;s grace!
Hadn&rsquo;t she heard of a preposterous religious notion
that dying a violent death, smashing up the body,
meant the soul was a long time making Heaven,
being slow to extricate itself from the flesh?
Why, at this moment her spirit had walked out on
her and was leaving her body to encounter the
dreadful thing unattended. <i>Too</i> dreadful&mdash;she
fled it down the nights and down the days.</p>
<p>She remembered climbing a big maple when she
was a child&mdash;a maple in autumn leaf&mdash;and being
drowned in a wave of pure, translucent color,
and lost to the world until she emerged on the
crest of the wave to a new world, seen from a
great height, and by new, color-stained eyes. She
remembered, as a test of courage, being made
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
by her father to traverse a grove of pines alone at
night and being frozen stone cold by the approach
of what proved to be pastured cattle. Uncle
Bertrand was sending them all through the
Valley of the Shadow of Death. How few of
them&mdash;<i>It moved!</i> Her mind sprang from this
hiding place of memories and fled precipitously to
crouch in an opposite corner: she remembered a
cool summer evening when she and her girlhood
friend raced around the block on bicycles, and the
horror that burst between them when a monster
car, in the days when cars were few and monstrous,
caught Margaret, and instantly killed her. She
remembered picking English cowslips, unlike our
American cowslip, in a Gloucestershire meadow,
when she wore a pink muslin dress with white
polka dots, and the yellow flowers with their imperishable,
indescribable scent drew her on like
Persephone from field to field. She remembered
being dragged screaming from her first moving
picture, a silent picture except for the gun fired
point blank at her by a Western desperado in a
close-up of face and gun-muzzle. If she could
scream like that now! She screamed inside until
her throat ached&mdash;and not a sound came. She
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
sprang to her feet and fled to the door, stumbling,
falling, stumbling&mdash;and yet she had not moved
by the fraction of an inch. Her mind, unable
to face things, again escaped. She remembered
spearing for suckers on a spring night, wading up
a wide, slow brook, and the way they were all, with
spears unlifted, fitfully illumined in the light of
oil-soaked torches. She remembered the day on
the beach at Shelter Island when Jerry had said,
&ldquo;Your wedding, you mean&rdquo; to her &ldquo;Is this making
two ends meet, when you spend more money
than we possess, always to be my funeral?&rdquo; She
remembered her black-and-red anger when he had
laughingly mocked her; &ldquo;Come now, my dear, I
admit you&rsquo;re a sweet bluffer, but for God&rsquo;s sake
don&rsquo;t try being European with me. A duel? I
know you too well. You haven&rsquo;t the lightness of
touch to get away with it.&rdquo; Jerry! She mustn&rsquo;t
think of Jerry now or she would find herself between
two fires&mdash;this new outer terror and the
old inner one. Jerry&rsquo;s face as&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh my God, It moved again! Too close this
time for <i>any</i> escape. Of course It knew she was
there. That&rsquo;s what It was here for. Where was
Julian? Why had he left her? The last image of
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
her open eyes had been of Julian sitting near her&mdash;the
last image of her mind&rsquo;s eye had been of him
still leaning over her, watching her drift into sleep.
For one flash she considered It as Julian. No-no-no-no-no.
<i>No</i>, he may have been a murderer
once, but he wasn&rsquo;t doing this to her now&mdash;he
wasn&rsquo;t, he wasn&rsquo;t. It was&mdash;was the one she
knew had killed the others: Blake, Romany, her
uncle. It was&mdash; And then, with relief not
even to have to <i>think</i> the name, she suddenly
yielded, and gratefully drank in the faint sweet
odor of a cloth that was thrown across her face and
bound at the back of her head. The little rodent,
with its petrified eyes and thudding heart, couldn&rsquo;t
have stood the thudding, as of a motor too powerful
for the body, another conscious second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<h2 id="c18">XVIII</h2>
<p>Detective Lieutenant Silas Berry
of the New York Homicide Squad was fine-tooth-combing
Romany&rsquo;s room for possible clues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.&mdash;Inspector&mdash;Lieutenant Berry.&rdquo; Julian
was inclined to embarrassment. &ldquo;Can you spare
me a few minutes? I want to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry laid his magnifying glass on the dresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would please me more, boy,&rdquo; he said
cheerfully, folding his arms and leaning against the
bed post. &ldquo;As you have undoubtedly observed, we
detectives just sit around waiting for someone to be
kind enough to confess and save our faces with a
critical public. What&rsquo;s on your mind? I think
it was you, Prentice,&rdquo; he continued without interruption,
&ldquo;who thought there were two shots fired
at Whittaker this morning. Not that he didn&rsquo;t
deserve a dozen to judge by the shambles he&rsquo;s made
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
of the place by that betrayal of poor old Crawford.
Are you still of the same opinion about
those shots in spite of Mr. Belknap&rsquo;s equal certainty
to the contrary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian was filling his pipe with unsteady fingers
in an effort to cover his excitement and pleasure
at Berry&rsquo;s tone of easy, natural camaraderie!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Berry. I am. But I admit my willingness
to be proved mistaken by anyone but Mr.
Belknap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve remarked that you and Mr. Belknap don&rsquo;t
exactly see eye to eye.&rdquo; Berry&rsquo;s lips twitched in
a half-smile. &ldquo;Or is it that you&rsquo;ve sighted identically,
to the point of interference&mdash;had <i>you</i> hit
on the Dorn solution too? You don&rsquo;t fancy such
a formidable rival, is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Yes, Dorn was my original suspicion,
and begins to look like my last. Do you really
think he&rsquo;s Mr. Belknap&rsquo;s, though? Isn&rsquo;t Mr.
Belknap afraid of the woman in the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Miss Mdevani, I suppose. Hold on
now, you shouldn&rsquo;t be asking <i>me</i> questions, young
man.&rdquo; Berry caught himself up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here
to answer them. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me and
think I&rsquo;m taking you on as a Watson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>But severe as the tone was, a quick glance at
Berry&rsquo;s face revealed a twinkle behind it, and
Julian was thrilled down to his bootstraps at the
intimate badinage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise not to flatter myself too much, Mr.
Berry,&rdquo; Julian smiled shyly. &ldquo;Now about those
shots, sir,&mdash;and then I have a clue or two I&rsquo;ve
been hoarding just for you. I heard two shots,
unless my hearing had gone double. I <i>was</i> tired,
but I hadn&rsquo;t been drinking. However, I&rsquo;m wrong
by the facts; the Colt had been fired but once. So
my testimony doesn&rsquo;t signify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amateur reasoning, Prentice. Try to figure
out why after you go to bed tonight&mdash;I hope you
are <i>going</i> to bed&mdash;and the effort will put you to
sleep better than sheep-counting. Or come and
tell me if you <i>do</i> find the nigger in your wood pile.
All right, give us your clues. I&rsquo;m all excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian produced his slip of thin white paper
with its cryptic message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see Colonel Blake was tagged and numbered,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you knew the code. Very keen
of you. Where did you find this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the stairs, after Mrs. Crawford screamed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the sum total of your knowledge of
its antecedents, birthplace, and purpose in life.
Then we&rsquo;re about as well off as we were a month
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian looked quenched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it be traced?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What with&mdash;a stencil? Never mind. Don&rsquo;t
let it worry you. Oh, I&rsquo;ll <i>keep</i> it,&rdquo; he added, as
Julian extended a hand. &ldquo;Our friend Stebbins
will enjoy it. <i>If</i> I show it to him. He hasn&rsquo;t
a flare for motives, but he eats up clues. Have
you others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly. But I thought I&rsquo;d better
mention that Miss Lacey just remembered the
name she was trying to recall. <i>You</i> know, the
name mentioned by Romany. It&rsquo;s Violet Mowbray.
Does it mean a blessed thing to you? It
doesn&rsquo;t to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry&rsquo;s eyes were intent on the pattern in the
rug. Again Julian could make nothing of his
face. Then Berry clicked his tongue, with a sound
like a miniature gunshot, and for the startled
Julian it registered the click of an idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhmmm?!&rdquo; Berry prolonged the interrogatory
exclamation with exaggerated softness.
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
&ldquo;Very strange. In fact, <i>very</i> strange. Thank
you, Prentice. You <i>are</i> contributing your bit at
last. It fits. It jolly well fits. Which is what
I&rsquo;m looking for, you know&mdash;things to fit <i>my</i>
preconceived idea. There are two ways of working
this detective racket, son&mdash;theory first and
theory last. Mine&rsquo;s first. I make my facts fit
the crime.&mdash; Hello, Belknap. Come in. Prentice
and I are having a truth party. Or rather he&rsquo;s
come across with a little truth after keeping it back
all afternoon. But I&rsquo;m being lenient with him because
he claims it&rsquo;s all due to my charms. He
saved up just to give me a few pointers. Aren&rsquo;t
you jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rraather.&rdquo; Belknap always went his English
ancestors one better in accent whenever his dignity
was endangered. &ldquo;Shall I retire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means. I&rsquo;m sure even the untutored
Prentice will agree that in matters of codes and
Violet Mowbrays three heads are better than two.
There&rsquo;s no such thing as too many detectives, is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violet Mowbray!&rdquo; Belknap showed sudden
and marked interest and for a man who rarely
showed any it <i>was</i> remarkable. He closed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
door. &ldquo;What about Violet Mowbray? I thought
I had her under lock and key. Is she abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. It was the name Miss Lacey
couldn&rsquo;t remember and has remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. How was it Miss Video mentioned
her. &lsquo;Revelation for revelation, with Violet
Mowbray thrown in?&rsquo; Was that it? It might
mean anything. After all, Violet Mowbray did
have a past. However, we&rsquo;d better look into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Lacey wasn&rsquo;t the only prowler last
night.&rdquo; Berry squinted at Julian, who stood looking
bewildered but pleased at the response to at
least one of his hopeful suggestions. &ldquo;The remark
may have meant more to another than it did to her.
And it can do no harm to look up Violet, poor
girl. One of your cruel cases, Belknap. Brilliantly
executed, of course, and justified in consequence
I suppose, but sinfully cruel. I&rsquo;m surprised
she&rsquo;s living. Though this doesn&rsquo;t prove she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> a sad affair. I regretted it myself. But
Blake was a close friend, and I saw my way to be
able to clear his name. Shall I give the prison a
ring? One of us could see her tomorrow&mdash;or
we could send a man out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do. But cast your mind&rsquo;s eye over this before
you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap took the coded message, scarcely glancing
at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. I wondered when I&rsquo;d see this again.
Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prentice recovered it on the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have dropped it there. I really hadn&rsquo;t
wanted to enter it as evidence unless it was necessary.
Particularly since I am convinced it has no
bearing. I received it from Miss Mdevani. She
was in a trap, as you can see. She brought me this
to show me in how desperate a trap. It was to
her advantage under the circumstances, to prevent
murder here last night. Though if it had been
just between the two of them with the world well
lost I&rsquo;m sure she would have blown Whittaker&rsquo;s
brains out and considered he escaped lightly for
his damned treachery. Mind, I&rsquo;m holding no brief
for her character. This would rise up to deny
me.&rdquo; He smiled ironically, lifting the paper at
them. &ldquo;She is no angel. But I shall have to be
shown about the present case. If you think, on
this account, I shall be less help than hindrance to
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
you and Stebbins I shall gladly withdraw, with no
hard feeling, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a minute, old man. Don&rsquo;t dream of
deserting me and the ship. In fact I wouldn&rsquo;t, I
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>, get on without you. I&rsquo;m not as cold-blooded
as you; and I don&rsquo;t in the least relish being
left alone by night, in a fog, with the rats either
dead or deserted. No, I guess I could bear up as
far as that&rsquo;s concerned. But I <i>do</i> look to you to
provide the missing link to what seems to me a
pretty bad tangle. Which reminds me I have an
important question to put to you. Run along,
Prentice, will you, like a good fellow? The
powers that be want to confer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian, having just congratulated himself on the
fact that they seemed to have completely forgotten
him, was sadly disappointed. He left them with
their heads together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<h2 id="c19">XIX</h2>
<p>Yes, Belknap and Berry at last had their heads
together in peace and quiet&mdash;if being cheek by
jowl with a tongue in each could be said to be having
their heads together. Greek was meeting
Greek, and, with reservations (decidedly with reservations!),
they put their cards on the table.</p>
<p>It was a <i>kind</i> of peace and quiet in which the
two men conversed. Nothing, thought Berry,
had ever seemed to him more hollow-still than
Thorngate that Saturday evening: fog outside, and
illness, depression, and possibly guilt inside. Like
the central vacuum of a cyclone it seemed to augur
as much trouble ahead as behind. He wished for
a moment that he and Belknap had let Sergeant
Stebbins carry out his obstinate desire, which had
been to run the whole lot down to the Blue Acres
lockup for the night. It had really been because
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
he relished the thought of catching somebody red-handed
that he had joined in Belknap&rsquo;s quiet but
determined resistance to the idea. Belknap&rsquo;s claim
was that the scandal in society was bad enough as
it was without herding several prominent and supposedly
honorable ladies and gentlemen into prison
as if they were one and all guilty of murder. It
was hardly likely they <i>were</i> all guilty, and the danger
of injured innocence was not fair to risk.</p>
<p>But Stebbins would undoubtedly have had his
way about the arrested Crawford, whom he had
proved backwards and forwards to his own satisfaction
guilty of Whittaker&rsquo;s murder, if Crawford
had not chosen an opportune moment to collapse
and be put to bed. Even the hardened Belknap
had shown a gleam of sympathy for the prostrated
Crawford and asked if someone hadn&rsquo;t a sleeping
drug. It was Nadia Mdevani who produced the
little red bottle from her vanity bag, poured a few
half-inch capsules into her cupped hand, and re-poured
them into Belknap&rsquo;s, who transferred them
to Sydney Crawford&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t survive without these,&rdquo; she had said.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re harmless enough&mdash;allanol or luminol, or
one of those things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>So every living soul that had been dining at
Thorngate the night before, always with the exception
of Dorn, was still there. It was this fact
of his absence that brought Dorn uppermost in the
Belknap-Berry discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No report on Milton Dorn?&rdquo; Berry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of any exact value to us. But one of
your men has unearthed a hidden room at the back
of his Eighty-fifth Street office, and in it several
human specimens in varying degrees of dissection.
None of these can hope to endure, but none have
been dealt the finishing stroke of the knife. The
press is hot on <i>that</i> scent, as you can well imagine.
And of course nothing will satisfy it but that
Dorn is guilty of our three murders and a few
besides. I wish I felt as sure of the three as of the
few besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that&rsquo;s all of no value to us? I should
think as a mark of character it might shed light
on the situation. However, it&rsquo;s useless to jump to
conclusions. <i>Our</i> whole case against Dorn is
summed up in his disappearance, added to your
possible glimpse of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly true. My answer referred merely to
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
the fact that he himself has not been traced, much
less located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Berry stroked his chin and glanced up
at Belknap with one eye shut. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in
too good a humor, old man. Stuck for an
answer? Don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am, Berry. I&rsquo;m mired.&rdquo; Belknap
smiled slowly, but failed to quite meet Berry&rsquo;s open
eye. &ldquo;The trouble being I haven&rsquo;t a flare about
this business. And unless my instincts are at work
I flounder. I&rsquo;m not good with a magnifying glass,
I must admit.&rdquo; And Belknap made a thrust of
his head at the glass on the table.</p>
<p>Berry laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither am I, really,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I bow to convention.
I know you don&rsquo;t. But neither are my
instincts particularly violent. A little luck, some
thinking, and an enormous amount of hard work
have got the poor boy where he is today. Don&rsquo;t
disparage him. A glass like this is a pretty little
tool of the trade. Boys like Prentice like to see
a detective without one as little as they like to
see a naturalist without a butterfly net. I&rsquo;m a detective,
you see; you&rsquo;re a genius. That&rsquo;s the difference&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
oh, the difference to me! Gee,
that rhymes, Belknap&mdash;internally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that on the face of it Belknap&rsquo;s reputation
exceeded Berry&rsquo;s because of the &lsquo;hunches&rsquo;
that made him spectacular. Yet Berry, for just
the reason that he lacked them, perhaps averaged
a greater percentage of successes than the older
man. Whereas Belknap&rsquo;s failures, according to
the fortune of heroes, passed unrecorded or were
forgotten overnight, Berry&rsquo;s went down in history.</p>
<p>Berry had recently written finis at the end of a
slow, grueling, painstaking case, begun five years
before&mdash;having of course had his hand in numberless
affairs, successful and unsuccessful, in the
meantime. The Star Diamond robbery round-up,
seen in a bird&rsquo;s eye view from beginning to end,
was a masterpiece of intricate workmanship and
cunning design, with Berry the spider. But it had
been too much to expect a fickle public attention
to remain riveted to a five-year hunt that led
around the world and back again. And what
newspaper would take the time to review it at sufficient
length to bring out its pattern in bas-relief.</p>
<p>Belknap, on the other hand, seldom was interested
in crimes at their birth. They had to pull
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
themselves together, assume character, even become
aged and ripened in the detective cellars,
before he woke up to them. Then suddenly with
the warp and the woof before him he saw the flaw,
the weak thread, and unraveled the whole in a
breath. Belknap had a certain contempt for
Berry&rsquo;s methods, though a sincere respect for his
achievements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about the luck in your case,
Berry,&rdquo; he said generously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s
always been far too much of it with me. I&rsquo;m <i>not</i>
a hard worker. And as for thinking, it happens
in wedges of intuition driven in between sleeping
and waking. I have damn little to do with it.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m up a tree now. I haven&rsquo;t had a
good sleep since the returns on these murders of
ours began to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look it. And unless I miss my
guess we&rsquo;ve got a bad night ahead of us. So let&rsquo;s
run over our lists to date and not leave the household
too long on its wild lone. Who are there to
be considered? Mr. and Mrs. Crawford; Prentice
and his girl-friend; Miss Mdevani; and this
missing Dorn. And <i>that</i> leaves out of account the
quite possible possibility that Blake killed Miss
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
Video, or <i>vice versa</i>, or that Whittaker killed both.
Violet Mowbray&rsquo;s name may be a stepping-stone
and it may prove just another stumbling-block.
What really interested me in Miss Video&rsquo;s remark
was the &lsquo;revelation for revelation&rsquo; bit. Did she
mean that because Whittaker was exposing her
lover Crawford she was going to pay him off?
For what she <i>could</i> have meant was that if you
are exposing <i>me</i> I&rsquo;ll get even with a story about
you and Violet Mowbray. In which case it would
bear out a little suspicion of mine about that Diary
you people seem so anxious to forget. Perhaps
the Diary had &rsquo;em <i>all</i> in it&mdash;not merely Crawford.
Whittaker may have been letting fifty-nine
cats out of the bag instead of one. He was
an old scoundrel, Whittaker, by accounts. If that
was so, with most of those here having interrelated
parts, what more likely than the only way for any
one of them to come clean was to wipe out every
other one, and the Diary with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap carefully regarded a thumb-nail, pausing
before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Astute reasoning, Berry. You&rsquo;re uncannily
warm, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know. I haven&rsquo;t had a
good opportunity to explain to you the method in
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
this madness, if there is any. Such as it is, it&rsquo;s
Whittaker&rsquo;s. The poor devil, though I swear I
can&rsquo;t be as sympathetic as I should be, was dying
of cancer, and witness his bright idea of a way to
shorten the sentence. He called me in at the last
minute to watch it done&mdash;too late to more than
expostulate and then resign myself to what I
thought was going to be rather a gruesome lark,
and has proved far too much of a good thing. I
assure you I didn&rsquo;t anticipate a shambles! I&rsquo;ve
kept this item for your ear alone because&mdash;well,
<i>you</i> know the police. Can&rsquo;t you picture that
damned sergeant hot and bothered on the trail of
a lot of stale crimes when the time is too short for
the new? What do you say about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry walked across and threw up a window.
&ldquo;Bad night,&rdquo; he said, and spit. He knocked the
ashes from his pipe on the stone outer sill, closed
the window deliberately, and came a few steps
back, refilling his pipe as he came, and keeping his
eyes on that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve let me do quite a bit of feeling around
in the dark, haven&rsquo;t you, boy? Oh, I don&rsquo;t
exactly blame you. After all, it was your case, not
mine. There&rsquo;s a catch-as-catch-can element between
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
us I guess we can&rsquo;t avoid. And aside from
that I agree with you that it would be rather low-down
to allow your friend the Judge to blight the
careers of his criminal friends because of certain
age-old professional secrets between them. For I
take it that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, exactly. But now that you <i>are</i> enlightened
what good is it to you? It&rsquo;s been of little
help to me to know that the Miss Laceys and
Mr. Prentices have their pasts. Can you see either
one of them with any of last night&rsquo;s blood on
their hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly. But we&rsquo;ve both had our
tragic experiences with gentle creatures who have
spread the veil of innocence over a positive welter
of sin. No, given your tale of what Whittaker
had set out to do, and has done to a T, the matter
boils itself down to a neat psychological one.
We&rsquo;re unable to budge with the circumstantial
evidence; unless the fact that all the circumstantial
points directly at your foreign lady, Miss Mdevani.
But I, for one, feel it&rsquo;s planted on her. I gather
it strikes you the same way? However, we
can&rsquo;t afford to eliminate her. As far as everyone
is concerned we only have their sworn word as
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
to how they spent last night: Miss Lacey in Mr.
Prentice&rsquo;s room, for the most part; Mr. Prentice
in the Judge&rsquo;s, except when he wasn&rsquo;t; the Judge
in Miss Video&rsquo;s, you think; Mrs. Crawford in her
own; Miss Mdevani very much out and about&mdash;and
yet not seen until her visit to you; Mr. Crawford
further out and about but not seen because of
the assignation with his wops. The few instances
in which we can check their stories we find them
quite uncommonly truthful. You saw Miss Lacey
when she says she came to the library for a drink.
Mrs. Crawford saw Mr. Prentice as he came from
the Judge&rsquo;s room, when she was on her way down
to find her husband and found Blake instead. No
one saw Blake. You kept moving and saw damn
little&mdash;unless you <i>did</i> see Dorn. I wasn&rsquo;t in
the picture until after two of the important episodes,
and too far afield to get much out of the
third. You were actually present at the third,
and a lot of good it did you. Which reminds me.
I just want to check that shooting with you again.
It bothers me. One shot, you say, from the direction
of the library wall, in other words from the
holes therein. Prentice <i>does</i> insist on two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one shot,&rdquo; Belknap said with controlled
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
quietness. &ldquo;I should think it would be
unnecessary for me to repeat myself. But there
<i>have</i> been cases of simultaneous, or all but simultaneous,
shots that might deceive one, more particularly
the person nearest the scene of action.
Do you suggest it might have been something of
that sort? Miss Mdevani in the wall, and Crawford
or his hired man in the pantry, shall we say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea in a nutshell. You see this is what I
found to make me such a nuisance on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry produced the bullet of a 22 calibre Colt
automatic from his vest pocket&mdash;a bullet apparently
identical to the one found in the table that
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I inquire?&rdquo; Belknap asked gravely, taking
the pellet on the palm of his hand and crossing it
from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my meticulous, persnickety way,&rdquo; Berry said
with his little twisted smile, &ldquo;I made a cleaner
sweep of the dining-room tonight than you and
I and the Sergeant did this morning when working
in unison.&rdquo; Berry had been known to strip a
freshly papered wall in his thoroughness! &ldquo;And
this article is the net result. Found <i>in</i> the sideboard&mdash;you
noticed that Chippendale thing between
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
the windows&mdash;inside, deep in the back
board, with the doors closed and no hole in the
doors. Meaning the doors were standing open
when the shot was fired, which, incidentally, means
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly; nothing at all. And of course it may
have been in hiding there for years, the relic of
some earlier shooting picnic at the Whittaker mansion!
But I congratulate you on the find, for it
<i>is</i> a find. We must get it to the ballistician, who
has Exhibit A, and let him determine which, if
either, came from our captured weapon. We
know only one shot could have come from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I&rsquo;ll take charge of it. You get in
touch with Miss Mowbray. I&rsquo;ll continue with
Miss Video&rsquo;s room while I&rsquo;m about it, and you go
mix with the gang. The more I hear about them
the less I like them unchaperoned. See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On either side the door each drew a long breath
that being translated meant &ldquo;I guess I gave him my
<i>facts</i> fair enough. Conclusions? <i>No.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c20">XX</h2>
<p>Sydney had been wandering the house like one
possessed. From her room where she stood inanimate
motionless beside Neil&rsquo;s bed, to the East Room
where she mechanically extended her hands to the
fire Nadia had herself built on the enormous hearth,
to the kitchens where she blindly prepared things
for Neil&rsquo;s comfort, she made the rounds with
frozen face and rigid body. The spirit was stricken&mdash;only
the form of Sydney went on living and
doing. Meeting far too many emotional crises
within far too short a space of time had destroyed
her receptivities; whether temporarily or permanently
remained to be seen.</p>
<p>Nadia was in the East Room, smoking furiously,
picking up and laying down bric-a-brac, books,
pictures, a glass of water, with indiscriminate and
hasty distraction. Seeing the ghost of Sydney pass
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
through for the sixth time her nerves were stung
to remonstrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Christ&rsquo;s sake, what&rsquo;s the matter, Mrs. Crawford?
One would think you were the only one
in trouble around here. Is it as bad as all that
with your husband? Can&rsquo;t he buck up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sydney halted in her tracks and stood gazing
straight through Nadia, through the walls, through
the outer fog, for several seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo; she said in a dragging voice. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come up with you.&rdquo; Nadia&rsquo;s bomb of
angry impatience burst in air and came softly
down. &ldquo;There may be something I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was an appreciable interval before
Sydney answered, her eyes distantly intent, as
though, a creature of another world, she listened
for echoes of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may come,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>They went up together to the Crawfords&rsquo; room,
passing in the lower hall a policeman sitting bolt
upright in a straight-backed chair against the wall
near the door. A high-low light was turned low
above the mirror-table beside him. It was all the
light for the hall and stairway. At the head of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
stairs another policeman, equally immobile and disinterested,
sat in a straight-backed chair against the
wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels like a hotel after 2 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, or a funeral
parlor at midday,&rdquo; Nadia cried at Sydney. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
turn up the lights and dance on the graves&mdash;throw
a celebration with horns and cymbals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sydney was deaf to her. And even Nadia&rsquo;s
bitter laughter died away when she had taken one
look at Crawford, felt his pulse, and listened to his
breathing. There was a horrid whitish edge of
something, like dried foam at a tide-mark, along
his upper lip. The lids of his eyes were neither
up nor down, but remained fixed half across the
pupils. His Adam&rsquo;s apple shifted a little, spasmodically.
Nadia swung on Sydney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little damn fool,&rdquo; she hissed. &ldquo;What do
you think you&rsquo;re doing&mdash;playing with death?
As if we hadn&rsquo;t had enough of it about. Did that
frightful idiot of a Dr. Giles go off duty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Sydney asked stonily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you give him the sedative I gave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, <i>did you give him the sedative I gave
you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Some tea, I think. And bicarbonate.
And&mdash;and water of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I tell you I don&rsquo;t know. What
are you driving at? Answer me! What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to make out I&rsquo;ve&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Shut</i> up, or I&rsquo;ll make you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sydney Crawford&rsquo;s eyes seemed to return at last
from the cosmic universe. They contracted and
shivered to points of horror. Everything about
her, from her clinched hands to her vivid chalk-white
face, put itself headlong into one word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Murderer!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nadia Mdevani was looking all too ready to
be one when Julian, standing in the door, interrupted
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me anything&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; he said with
a thin sarcasm.</p>
<p>Poised against each other as the two women
were, it took them both several breaths to withhold
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
their momentum and divert it to new channels.
Nadia was the first to recover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a doctor, Mr. Prentice,&rdquo; she said
quietly. &ldquo;And we need him soon.&rdquo; She threw a
glance in Crawford&rsquo;s direction and, in a low voice,
risked more: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a few poisons in my day,
and this <i>is</i> a poison! Arsenic. You know how
rapid that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sydney sprang toward Julian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Mr. Prentice! I tell you if you
go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Julian had fled; down the corridor, down the
dim stairs, and out into the fog. They heard the
door close loudly behind him. Sydney dropped her
hands loosely, resignedly, at her sides. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
that,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Not that it really matters.
I am completely at your mercy, Miss Mdevani.
You may think it makes a difference. It doesn&rsquo;t.
There are others now who care as little as Bertrand
Whittaker cared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nadia looked her up and down with cold contempt
and a colder pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mrs. Crawford. Your time is
not yet. Not <i>quite</i> yet.&rdquo; She pushed back her
shining ebony hair with her two hands. &ldquo;It appears
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
I must be the one to do it at that&mdash;the chosen
of the Lord. For the mortification of the flesh.&rdquo;
She was speaking to herself, not to Sydney.</p>
<p>Crawford shifted a little, and moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in pain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Sydney neither stirred, nor looked toward
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, something is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil seemed to be considering that. Beads of
perspiration stood out on his forehead, and on the
backs of his hands lying weakly on the coverlid.
His dry lips thinned perceptibly. Then, on a
breath, he only said again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you, Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; Nadia cried
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sydney.&rdquo; Crawford&rsquo;s monotonous, sad repetition
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
of her name was the tragic undertone in the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quick about it,&rdquo; Nadia screamed in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know as well as I do what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sydney.&rdquo; His voice was weaker.</p>
<p>The effort by which Sydney moved her limbs
and went to Neil&rsquo;s side was painful to watch, like
the first steps of a Frankenstein conception. She
bent over him a little and laid her hand across his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Neil. There is nothing wrong.
I didn&rsquo;t mean there was. It has been so hard for
you. So bad I can&rsquo;t remember how bad. If I remembered
I&rsquo;d die. Perhaps you are remembering.
Don&rsquo;t let it kill you, dear. For you and I have so
much to do. We are going to go on from where
we laid our story down&mdash;was it a year ago? I&rsquo;m
sure we can find the very page, paragraph and sentence
where we left off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil smiled. It was the smile of a blind person,
sweet and helpless. He moved a little nearer Sydney,
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
and lay perfectly still. How long the three in
the room remained speechless and motionless it
would have been hard to say. It was Belknap who
disturbed two of them; the third was beyond all
further disturbance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<h2 id="c21">XXI</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What have we here&mdash;a s&eacute;ance?&rdquo; Belknap
asked from the door.</p>
<p>Nadia quivered and shrank back against the wall
as she turned to face Belknap. Her hands, with
spread fingers, formed a spidery white pattern
against the room&rsquo;s daring modernistic wall-paper of
black shot with gold. Her eyes wavered, and Belknap
saw them consider the open window leading
to the roof of the porte-coch&egrave;re.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Belknap!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your humble servant.&rdquo; Belknap closed the
door, turned its key and pocketed the key, and
crossed to the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s ailing our friend Crawford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust Sydney Crawford aside with an arm
that would have brooked no interference had there
been any. He looked down at Crawford; then
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
bent over him; and then, quickly, felt for the heart.
His face darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is dead,&rdquo; he said, straightening and
turning toward Nadia Mdevani.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Sydney cried, and Belknap
swung to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another Strange Death of President Harding,
is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to say, Mr. Detective,&rdquo; Sydney
answered with unexpected fire. &ldquo;But this is the
second time today you have accused me of murder;
and I should have thought, unless you can
make your point better than you made it this morning,
you might exercise a greater professional restraint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a blazing light in Sydney&rsquo;s transparent face
it was clear things no longer mattered a tinker&rsquo;s
dam: life, death, love, hatred were all one to her,
which was nothing. Belknap regarded her with
merciless, puckered eyes, and turned again to her
husband. He touched a light forefinger to the
powder on Crawford&rsquo;s corroded lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poison is my guess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out
where it came from soon enough. You&rsquo;ve run it
too close, Miss Mdevani. I shall have to examine
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
the remainder of that sleeping drug you so kindly
offered. <i>If</i> it&rsquo;s still in your possession. Hmmm!
No you don&rsquo;t, lady&mdash;stand where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have frightened you,&rdquo; Nadia drew
back and spoke with slow venom. &ldquo;I merely
thought to assist you. You&rsquo;ll find it in the middle
compartment of my handbag.&rdquo; With her eyes she
indicated the bag on the dresser. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;alone?&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite alone, Miss Mdevani. But not for long
I assure you.&rdquo; Belknap went to the telephone:
(&ldquo;Operator, give me 40. Thanks. Police Headquarters?
Give me Sergeant Stebbins. Oh, that
you, Stebbins? You&rsquo;d better come up. Your
catch has gone the way of all flesh&mdash;which, in this
house, means he has been murdered. But I have
a good substitute. So come along and help me.
Right.&rdquo;) He hung up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Berry?&rdquo; Nadia asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing research work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see him, if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should? Why? My opinion is that I
make a better father confessor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it. I prefer a layman that&rsquo;s all&mdash;as
safer in the long run.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>How he admired her Custer stand. He knew,
if she didn&rsquo;t, that she was literally at the end of her
rope. He hadn&rsquo;t a doubt in his mind that her bag
contained the poison. This poisoning business was
always such a risky affair. He felt convinced that
in the excitement she had neglected to exchange the
contents of the bottle. Yet she was boldly facing
it out to the last ditch. It was proving a gallant
fight, if a criminal&rsquo;s fight can be called gallant.
And, admiring her, he wanted her more than ever.
His eyes absorbed her as she stood there slim and
taut, outlined in the light that, being shielded from
Crawford, fell directly upon her. She wore a
clinging dress of bitter-sweet red. It shaped her
narrow hips, her lovely forward drooping shoulders.
There were slippers to match the dress; coral
in her ears; a half dozen barbaric coral bracelets
high on her arm; a large bloodstone ring on her
index finger. She seemed not so much savage as
heathen, a descendant of Attila. It was a thousand
pities, Belknap thought, to have her broken in this
sordid fashion: law courts, disgrace, and, short of
death, a prison. How much more fun to break
her himself, in a man&rsquo;s way. But it was too late
now. The cards were stacked against her, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
didn&rsquo;t need her enough to follow her lead to Hell.
He drew a breath and relinquished her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite possible. Safety is not a term you
and I have conjured with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. We have never pretended to be anything
but dangerous to each other. And this was
scarcely the moment to have drawn in our horns.
But that shouldn&rsquo;t destroy our relationship, should
it? For I believe it was you who first made a claim
to courage. You put it rather neatly, I remember,
calling it the coin of our realm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again her irony, and he flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was flattered, my dear, when you challenged
me to catch you at one murder.&rdquo; (God, he
thought to himself, what kind of a grip has this
woman got on me that I should stand here arguing,
with a corpse on the bed between us!) &ldquo;I have
ceased to be flattered. Four is far too simple a
problem; particularly when you let yourself be
tripped up in the fourth act.&rdquo; Belknap was opening
her bag. He held up the little red bottle for
reflections. &ldquo;Your stop-light,&rdquo; he said with his
cruel, side-wise smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your play on words, sir, is one of the most delightful
things about you. I see it doesn&rsquo;t fail you
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
under trying circumstances.&rdquo; Nadia&rsquo;s color was
up. She was positively enjoying this linguistic
sword play. Belknap hated himself for having let
himself be snared into it. She was playing for
time. Exactly what good it would do her he failed
to see. But the furtive half-eye she gave to the
door, the furtive half-ear she gave to what might
be happening outside, meant she was biding an opportunity.
And something was at last happening
outside. Suddenly the door of the lower hall was
opened and closed repeatedly and vehemently.
There were loud voices, and someone in a querulous
rage was insistently keeping the upper hand.
There was a scuffle on the stairs. Belknap went to
the door, and paused with the key in his hand. He
looked quickly at Sydney&rsquo;s quiescent figure lying
curled up at Crawford&rsquo;s feet&mdash;she had fallen into
a deep sleep, or perhaps a faint, at some moment
of the conversation; how little attention had been
paid her!&mdash;and then back at Nadia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, dearest,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;go by the window!
Forgive me, it&rsquo;s the best I can do.&rdquo; He
was surprised at his own words. But her shuddering
tremor at the approach of the others had
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
been the last straw. He couldn&rsquo;t go with her but
he could let her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she answered gently. &ldquo;I am not
running away. I have never run even when guilty.
Is it likely I should try it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, and with an angry twist of his
arm, he turned the key in the lock and flung the
door wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Stebbins. You too, Berry. I want
one of you. And Miss Mdevani, I understand,
wants the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Mr. Berry.&rdquo; Nadia stepped forward and
stood near him. &ldquo;I hereby place myself wholly in
your charge. Whether I am guilty or innocent of
all of which I am accused has yet to be determined.
Until it is determined I am confident you will extend
me fair play. Mr. Belknap, I regret to say,
is now as assured of my guilt as he recently claimed
to be of my innocence. Such variable winds cannot
fail but be ill winds for one in my delicate
position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool and tricky!&rdquo; thought Berry, putting the
room to a quizzical scrutiny. &ldquo;What a perfectly
worded appeal. No male could resist it.&rdquo; Aloud
he said, &ldquo;I promise you will receive every consideration
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
justified by the circumstances.&rdquo; And, to
Belknap, &ldquo;I see we <i>did</i> leave them too long alone.
The tally mounts! But I take it we have reached
the end of the trail. My congratulations. I
<i>thought</i> you would come across, and I&rsquo;m sincerely
glad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disturbance on the stairs had moved up and
now suddenly intruded itself. Julian Prentice
proved to be at its center&mdash;pale, disheveled, his
tie twisted, his hair up-ended, Julian struggled
feverishly with a veritable regiment of cops. His
captors were so intent on their prize and on his
retention that it would have taken a dozen murders
to have shaken their concentration; such is
the Force&rsquo;s strength of character! In spite of
everything, even his own nature, Belknap had to
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this you&rsquo;ve got? I figured the least
you could be doing was bringing in Milton Dorn.
What&rsquo;s Prentice been at to so rouse your righteous
wrath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tryin&rsquo; to escape, sir. Ran his car right off&rsquo;n
the premises. We did have a chase, sir! He was
doin&rsquo; seventy in the fog. It was as good as suicide,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;A verdict of suicide would be a relief. Come,
come, boys, hands off. Can&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re bothering
him? Where were you heading, Prentice,
for Times Square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian, standing free at last, shifted his gaze distractedly
from the vibrant, defiant figure of Nadia
Mdevani, to Silas Berry standing like an off-stage
critic, to Ordway Belknap who looked a general
with the puppets at his disposal, to Sydney Crawford
lying crumpled and desperately pathetic across
the feet of the still form on the bed, and suddenly
he trembled uncontrollably from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Joel?&rdquo; he cried in a high, piercing
voice that froze the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<h2 id="c22">XXII</h2>
<p>From this moment Thorngate, house and
grounds, was pandemonium let loose.</p>
<p>It was clear that the first thing to be done, when
it became certain that Joel Lacey was really among
the missing, and had last been seen sleeping on the
library couch, was to institute a searching party.
Because of the numberless recruits, three groups
were formed&mdash;two taking the great outdoors and
one the sliding panels and the secret attics. The
way the police, Belknap groaned, came scurrying
out of corners, like the Hamlin rats to the piper&rsquo;s
pipe, at news of a safe and sane hunt, when there
was never one of them underfoot when he was
needed to block a murder, made one positively ill.
Not that the hunt wasn&rsquo;t important. But the bare
chances of <i>finding</i> Joel Lacey, much less finding her
alive, seemed so slight in view of the thoroughness
of the earlier crimes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>In the midst of it all, behind and before, to right
and to left, came Julian. Julian joined first one
searching party, then another, urging, beseeching,
cursing, cajoling, diving into a closet or under a
bush as the case might be. Julian was every which
way. Julian was at sixes and sevens. Julian had
gone berserk. Losing Joel, Julian seemed to have
lost whatever of value he had recently possessed:
his boyish philosophy, such as it was; his sense of
humor, which hadn&rsquo;t been bad; his kindly, inconsequential
wit which had served rather to balance
the household during the late unpleasantness.
These had vanished in thin air. Instead here was
a frantic, unreasonable, hysterical, bothersome
young man who dogged everyone&rsquo;s footsteps like a
spoilt child, stubbornly refused to remain even
passably steady, and flung wild and outrageous accusations
about like so much confetti. No one
escaped his fury or his suspicions. Even his idol
Berry took a raking over the coals that under normal
conditions would have been unpardonable.
But when Julian burst into tears at the end of his
peroration Berry let that be the end of it.</p>
<p>Julian said no one was <i>trying</i> to find Joel; he
said Nadia Mdevani had cremated Joel in the furnaces
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
and they must sift the ashes for her bones;
he said Milton Dorn was murdering her by unspeakable
degrees in some god-forsaken hole-in-the-wall
where her screams would never be heard; that
Belknap, Berry, and Stebbins had whisked her off to
some Inquisitorial chamber where their minions
were torturing a statement from her. He said the
whole investigation from A to Z had been stupidly
handled (he said it very loud and clear, and embellished
it with bad words); that a lot of helpless
and innocent people had been kept in a house which
had a chronic disposition to murder, where they
had been nipped off one by one like sheep by
wolves; that Thorngate was proving no better than
an Island of Dr. Moreau, only worse, because it
was human beings instead of rabbits being experimented
with; he said&mdash;</p>
<p>But this was going one further than the harassed
Belknap could quite tolerate. He thrust Julian
gently but firmly from the East Room into the
hall, saying, as he closed the door on him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along, Prentice. I&rsquo;m sorry. We&rsquo;re doing
all we can, and the best possible. I have even got
in touch with Headquarters again and have asked
them to send an extra man or two. I admit things
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
are pretty damn thick, but you aren&rsquo;t thinning
them out. So beat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Belknap turned back to continue, with
Berry and Stebbins, the heated interrogation of
Nadia Mdevani by which they hoped to run her
to earth by her own admission, and so, clearing the
decks of legal red-tape, hasten and simplify her path
that led but to the grave as best you looked at it.
For, admitted or not admitted, denial could no
longer stand against a sealed order to kill Blake, a
gun left lying on the scene of Whittaker&rsquo;s murder,
and a poisoned sleeping drug administered to Crawford.
This last, in a brief preliminary test, Belknap
had proved to be arsenous oxide; anyway arsenic
in one of its forms.</p>
<p>They had of necessity quickly abandoned all
attempts on Sydney Crawford. Not that she
stood above suspicion, hardly that (Stebbins had
even taken it upon himself to arrest her willy-nilly),
but Sydney, passing from one phase of excessive
shock to another, was now wandering the
house like a modern Ophelia, modern in that nothing
she said bore the least resemblance to her predecessor&rsquo;s
soliloquy. She said cruel, bitter, terrible
things to the walls and the ceilings in a hard, glinting
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
voice: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call up Victor and tell him his
Daddy&rsquo;s dead. He&rsquo;ll remember it for life if he&rsquo;s
fetched out of bed to be told.&rdquo; &ldquo;The place to stab
a man with a paper knife is between the fourth
and fifth vertebr&aelig;, I mean ribs. I&rsquo;ve found <i>that</i>
out.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, Romany, if it&rsquo;s true that the first
two of a triangle to die make the couple in Heaven,
<i>you</i> should worry now. You&rsquo;ve got him.&rdquo; Until
she changed her tune a little there was no use
bothering with her, for questioning or pressure
brought to bear might push her beyond this ragged
edge of insanity.</p>
<p>No danger of insanity in Nadia Mdevani&rsquo;s case!
But apparently no danger either of obtaining any
satisfaction from her. Wanting a confession from
her was one thing&mdash;obtaining even a modicum of
it was another. Nadia sat limply, almost unconcernedly,
in a deep chair before the East Room fire,
and, never lifting her eyes from a bemused contemplation
of the flames, refused to yield a hair&rsquo;s
breadth of vantage to her tormentors. The
ground they covered with her was the old ground
covered in the morning, but, though her three examiners
bore the same names that they had then
born, they were three men of different attitude
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
and temper. Each blaming himself secretly for an
earlier male to female softness, that had perhaps
been responsible for the extra hot water they were
now in, was now out for blood in earnest, beauty
or no beauty. It angered them that she seemed
not to notice a difference. Quite as collected,
equally as cool, as during the morning&rsquo;s session on
the stand, she shed their individual and concerted
attacks.</p>
<p>Yes, she had received the order regarding Colonel
Blake. No, she could not say when, or from
whom. That was for them to find out&mdash;<i>if</i> they
could. Yes, she had taken it to Mr. Belknap.
Why? She didn&rsquo;t exactly know; an impulse.
Perhaps a wily way to further the intimacy between
them! Here she threw a little whimsical smile in
Belknap&rsquo;s direction. If he saw it he gave no sign.
She said she intended telling him she had not obeyed
orders&mdash;even though Blake lay dead at that moment
on the library floor. She had intended asking
his protection, such protection as a man of law and
justice, power and respect, can give a woman of
doubtful antecedents. The sarcasm, if there was
any, was ever so slight.</p>
<p>What <i>had</i> she been doing during the hours before
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
consulting with Mr. Belknap? Oh-my-God,
her weary tone of telling and retelling implied,
what a twice and thrice told tale to repeat. She
had gone to her room and been restless. Naturally;
no one else had claimed to be anything <i>but</i> restless
last night, and she wouldn&rsquo;t profess to be any exception
to the rule. She had read a little, and then
done a bit of reconnoitering&mdash; Oh well, <i>call</i> it
prowling. What difference did it make? She had
been made aware, putting the two of his absence
from his own room and the two of his voice in
Romany&rsquo;s together, that Bertrand Whittaker was
paying a visit. And that couldn&rsquo;t be said to have
made her any the less upset. Not that she would
have called him one of your story-book lovers; but
this evening she needed him to be his own best
friend with her in his own behalf. Her new distrust
of him, a blend of anger, disrespect and fear,
rising from his cat-and-mouse play with his Diary,
was running her blood up close to killing heat.
Romany was rather a last straw. She had returned
to her room for her Colt, to find it had disappeared
from the dresser; and had gone on down for a
drink to restore her equilibrium. Again her smile.
It was then she had remarked the gnawing of a rat
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
in the wainscoting&mdash;a persistent rat, Mr. Belknap;
a purposeful rat; one intent on going places. She
had left him working his way through, and had
gone for a long cooling-off stroll, down to the water
and back. What a night! What a moon!</p>
<p>Stepping back over the low sills into the library,
and crossing the dark room to the door dimly
blocked in by the hall light, her foot had encountered
something soft and humpy. By that seventh
sense that comes to one&rsquo;s aid at such moments she
knew it for a body. She had her own pocket flash.
Turning it up she discovered Blake. The message
she had received was illumined in red letters. She
was on the point of destroying it when Belknap
occurred to her mischievous mind! It was Mrs.
Crawford who had interrupted their exciting t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</p>
<p>Romany? The first she had seen of Romany
last night was this morning when, with the others,
she had seen her dead. No, it wasn&rsquo;t Romany she
would have killed under the spur of jealousy&mdash;if
they wanted to name it jealousy&mdash;but Whittaker.
<i>Another</i> reason for killing Whittaker, whom she
hadn&rsquo;t killed. Not even in his case was she guilty,
much as she had intended being. Someone had
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
been ahead of her. Someone who had planted her
gun with one shot fired from it&mdash;and in using
another gun had had the misfortune to have to
fire twice in order to get the victim cold.</p>
<p>The three men exchanged glances of unmistakable
surprise and shock. This was new testimony on
Nadia&rsquo;s part, though not altogether fresh, and an
entirely new explanation of it. But Nadia never
showed by as much as a shifted finger that she realized
the importance of what she had just let fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two shots!&rdquo; Berry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said two shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You agree with Prentice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you said so before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had my reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you care to put it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suspected and were afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected. I was not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your explanation of the two shots&mdash;whether
true or false&mdash;is amazingly clever.&rdquo; Belknap was
deeply respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stebbins interrupted angrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what about your amatol turning out to
be arsenic. Got as clever a way out of that,
lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need it&mdash;and wouldn&rsquo;t take it if I did.
It&rsquo;s self-explanatory. Oh, you detectives!&rdquo; Nadia
threw back her head and laughed suddenly,
weakly, brokenly. &ldquo;If you want to send me to
eternity for Crawford&rsquo;s murder you are welcome
to do it that I may have the last laugh on you with
the Devil in Hell. He&rsquo;d understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands. It was impossible
to be certain whether she was laughing
still, or crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of here, you two,&rdquo; Berry said quietly
to Belknap and Stebbins. &ldquo;I want a word with
Miss Mdevani alone.&rdquo; He herded them unceremoniously
toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got under her skin,&rdquo; he added under his
breath. &ldquo;I think with an extra hint or two that I
have the means to convey (remember she&rsquo;s not new
to me) we&rsquo;ll have her where we want her in half a
jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shut the door carefully and returned to
Nadia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<h2 id="c23">XXIII</h2>
<p>It was a defeated Nadia Mdevani who emerged
from what proved to be a prolonged interview
with Lieutenant Berry. If, before it, she looked
worn and troubled, her will had at least remained
indomitable. If her voice had flagged, her eyes
lost their challenge, yet she had always managed
to convey an impression of impregnable right shall
be might. Now she had yielded everything, to all
appearances, and came carrying her weapon by the
blade and laid across her forearm for the victor to
accept the hilt. Her face was haggard; her unquenchable
color quenched; her feet scarcely lifted;
she twisted her clasped hands together as though
they were manacled. When she spoke it was in a
voice not her own, a voice in which despair had
even surpassed weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Berry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I understand
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
perfectly. I shall make no attempt to escape,
I swear. I am not the kind. When I am beaten
in fair play I am as willing to dance to the music
as I am when I win and the tune is gayer. I only
ask one favor before I go with you. May I have
a few words with Mr. Belknap in private? That
is, if he will condescend to have a few words with
me. He may even put me to the indignity of a
search for concealed firearms if he so desires.&rdquo;
There was a flicker of the old Nadia as she looked
up at Belknap on the last words.</p>
<p>Belknap and Berry exchanged glances, and there
was a faint nod of acquiescence on Berry&rsquo;s part.
It didn&rsquo;t escape Nadia. She smiled dimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Berry. I will not transgress
your orders, on my honor.&rdquo; With a little characteristic
shrug of a shoulder she motioned Belknap
to follow her. She led him into the library, and,
closing the door, leaned against it as though she
had reached the farthermost limit of endurance.
Her drooping figure, her shattered face, so pierced
Belknap with their utter resignation that before
he could trust himself to speech she had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chamber of Horrors,&rdquo; she murmured with
a dim twitch at the corners of her sad mouth. &ldquo;Do
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
you object to seeing me here? It is here we truly
met for the first time. Do you remember last
night, the things we said, and the things we left
unsaid? Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s leave anything unsaid tonight.
Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry to be so pathetic and so obvious.&rdquo;
She half lifted her eyes to him and let them fall
away, but he had a glimpse of the pride in them
struggling to master an emotion he dared not name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;What did
he do to you? I&rsquo;ll kill the bastard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, what didn&rsquo;t he do! But never
mind that. I don&rsquo;t have to tell you about it, you
can see for yourself what I have come to. I am
ashamed. I had so fully intended to go down, if
I had to go down, with flags up&mdash;denying, denying,
denying&mdash;and here I am, not only confessed
to murders, but confessed to murders I never committed.
What irony, what bitter irony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You confessed?&rdquo; he cried softly, and taking her
two arms in his two hands he drew her unresistingly
forward into the room. He drew her to the
light where he could see her face. &ldquo;Nadia, tell me
that is not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true. There comes a time in these affairs
when it is easier to admit than to deny, or rather,
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
when one becomes careless and callous of the consequences
of guilt. Will someone stop that damned
youngster breaking his heart out there! I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
tell him where his girl-friend is because I don&rsquo;t
know, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she screamed;
but the scream, from sheer exhaustion, scarcely rose
above a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, dear! Don&rsquo;t let him worry you. He
has lost his head too dreadfully. And you mustn&rsquo;t
confess, you <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i>, do you hear? Even if you
killed the lot, don&rsquo;t admit it&mdash;<i>ever</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can I do? You have me on so many
counts. There&rsquo;s no use standing up against circumstantial
evidence forever&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s planted
evidence, as this happens to be. I could never
prove it. And the way I feel now the sooner
things are over the better. I&rsquo;m tired, tired out.
I&rsquo;m rapidly joining that Mrs. Crawford in her state
of detachment and disenchantment. How beautifully
she&rsquo;s behaving now, not a trace of agony or
hysteria; not because she&rsquo;s thought it out, it isn&rsquo;t
philosophy with her, but because she&rsquo;s died and
remained alive. It leaves one with a jolly nonchalance.
Well, short of one barb that persists
in hurting me like Hell, I promise you I can
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
go to the chair without a flicker.&rdquo; His hands
still held her and had unwittingly tightened on her
arms. She looked down at them. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> hurting
me rather,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He relaxed his hold but did not
release her. &ldquo;Tell me, what is the pain?&rdquo; He
knew, but he wanted to hear. They both trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can. There should be nothing left, as
you say, that you and I cannot say to each other.
We have been through too much, we have seen
too much, ever to let pride interfere between us
again. And you can depend upon me to the end
of creation. I&rsquo;ll never let them distress you&mdash;never,
never, never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I hadn&rsquo;t been distressed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. And I have been one of the worst.
I&rsquo;m sorry, so terribly sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know.&rdquo; She lifted her eyes, steadily at
last, to meet his, and he saw their depths below
depths of suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly they clung together. And all the
time his mind whirled against itself. How in
God&rsquo;s name, at his time of life, could any woman
be doing this to him! Perhaps even now she was
tricking him for a way out for herself. But he
felt her shivering against him, felt her lips, and
knew that was not true. For, together with her
love for him, he felt an overwhelming despair in
her that frightened him&mdash;as though she fully intended
to go through with her mad confession.
It was mad to have admitted anything! It was
going to make his efforts to save her almost hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said huskily, trying to hold
her off and only holding her closer. &ldquo;We have
other things to think of. It&rsquo;s desperate. They&rsquo;re
waiting for us. In the first place you must retract
whatever you have said, and we&rsquo;ll try to clear
you in the courts. Failing that, we&rsquo;ll make a get-away&mdash;Timbuctu
or the Gold Coast, it makes no
difference to me. I&rsquo;m as tired of the game as you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let
you do that, ever. Oh, my dear, I didn&rsquo;t mean to
tell you how much I cared. Truly I didn&rsquo;t. I
only meant to say good-bye to you. I couldn&rsquo;t
deny myself that. I don&rsquo;t understand how this
other happened. I suppose because we both cared.
I hadn&rsquo;t an idea you did. You have been considerate
in some ways, yes, but not really kind. But
now I see what it&rsquo;s been for you. You have been
fighting it too, as I have. How cruel to know at
the very moment of separation. For it <i>is</i> good-bye.
It can&rsquo;t be anything else, for either of us. Please,
no&mdash;don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t kiss me. I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still. We are going to get you off, dear
heart. You must be brave, that&rsquo;s all; and help
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I am not going to let you <i>try</i> to get me
off. We have you to think of now. Not me any
longer. I am beyond being worried about. I
never expected to escape the fruits of my sins as
long as I have. That I happen to die innocent is
a queer twist of fate, nothing more. I would have
died really guilty of something within a month&mdash;a
year. Who knows? And I&rsquo;ve put up a good battle,
as battles go in this world. I have just got
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
around to surrender. I&rsquo;m through. So it&rsquo;s fare
thee well, dear, forever and ever, instead of&mdash;of
&lsquo;they lived&mdash;.&rsquo;&rdquo; Her voice broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stop</i> it!&rdquo; He shook her fiercely. &ldquo;Pull
yourself together, Nadia. For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t
stand here talking sentimental nonsense. What we
have to do is <i>plan</i>. The enemy is outside that door;
can&rsquo;t you realize that? We&rsquo;ll have to have every
ounce of our wits about us to fend them off.
What did you admit? Tell me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything. Every murder. What was the
point of haggling over an extra one or two. And,
what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m sticking to it, darling.&rdquo; She drew
a deep breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only solution. Believe
me, it is. Nothing in the wide world, including
death twenty times over, could make me let you
undertake your wild scheme for us. My dear, you
are a great man, a strong one, an esteemed one. I
am a wretched little criminal&mdash;clever, yes, but
wretched all the same. Do you think loving you,
worshiping you as I do, I could dream of letting
you face downright ruin for my sake? It isn&rsquo;t to
be thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nadia stood back and lifted her face to his.
Her eyes were wide open, lucid, adoring, and, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
him, the mirrors of love and integrity. Then, as
she gazed at him, the tears, the first he had ever
seen her shed, and he had thought her incapable
of tears, welled up and fell quietly across her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, don&rsquo;t you understand that? Don&rsquo;t
you understand what love means? I couldn&rsquo;t let
you hurt yourself for me. The very fact of my
love for you makes it absolutely imperative I never
retract a word I have said to them. For my confession
puts me out of harm&rsquo;s way and so puts
temptation out of yours.&rdquo; Her little smile came,
tender now.</p>
<p>Belknap walked away from her and back, restlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nadia,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I have things to say to
you I never intended saying. But I see I must be
honest with you to bring you to your senses. You
have got to be shocked into fighting if we are going
to save ourselves for each other. Which is all that&rsquo;s
left that matters&mdash;our having each other&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she whispered breathlessly, a hand at her
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will understand and forgive, for that
reason, and for another, almost as important, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
you are no better than I am. We are birds of a
feather and can properly appreciate each other,&rdquo;
he added with a grim laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean we are equally criminals, Nadia. In this
case I happen to be the worse one of the two. I&rsquo;ve
killed five people (that is, if Joel Lacey is dead yet)
since four o&rsquo;clock this morning. Rather a record,
isn&rsquo;t it? Do you know, there have been times
when I was sure you guessed, <i>more</i> than guessed.
And on top of it I have made you confess to the
whole show, which was also plotted. <i>I</i> planted
that circumstantial evidence upon you, dear.
Couldn&rsquo;t you see? I was intent on beating you at
your own game. God, what a beautiful job I made
of it! One of my best. And now to have it
busted up by a slip of a woman. Not that it isn&rsquo;t
worth it,&mdash; Nadia, don&rsquo;t <i>look</i> at me like that.
You&rsquo;re <i>not</i> looking at me. What <i>are</i> you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dining-room door behind Belknap had stood
ajar by the shadow of an inch. It was now thrown
open and Stebbins and Berry advanced on Belknap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; Stebbins thundered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hands up, Belknap,&rdquo; Berry said. &ldquo;Thank
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
you, Miss Mdevani. That was splendidly done.
You acted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry should have saved his congratulations. As
Belknap raised his hands he drew his pistol from
his shoulder holster, and, though he would never
have had the extra second to swing on his captors,
he did have the split fraction of a second to fire
straight before him. The shot of his 38 calibre
police revolver was deafening. Nadia, shot directly
through the breast, put her two hands where
the bullet had entered, and without a sound fell in
an uneven heap at Belknap&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<h2 id="c24">XXIV</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>He knocked the pistol out of his hand, small room was there to strive</i></p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;<i>&rsquo;Twas only by favor of mine,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;ye rode so long alive.</i>&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The game was up. Almost on the instant that
the shot was fired Berry struck down Belknap&rsquo;s
hand and twisted the gun from him. There was
no flicker of resistance on Belknap&rsquo;s part. Nor
would there have been the chance of any if Stebbins
had had his way. For the Sergeant was a prey to
impulsive rages and quick on the trigger. If Berry,
in tackling Belknap, had not had a strong arm for
Stebbins, Belknap would have joined Nadia Mdevani
in the dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Berry cried sharply. &ldquo;Not that way.
Shooting&rsquo;s too good for him. And we want the
dope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Stebbins, like copper wire, cooled off as rapidly
as he had heated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s rank
cold-blooded murder to shoot a lady down like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry had to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not his first one, Sergeant; you should be used
to &rsquo;em. Come on, lend a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They bound Belknap, securely. No more playing
with fire. And a swift body-search from head
to foot revealed several damning articles of trade:
Whittaker&rsquo;s Diary in an inner pocket; several varieties
of poison in neatly labeled pill-boxes; a pair of
su&egrave;de gloves; a very exquisite six-inch dagger with
an inlaid handle of silver and lapis; a kit for the
designing and manufacture of keys; a veritable
armory of revolvers, six; a cunningly contrived
combination tool that in its various transformations
became a screw-driver, a hammer, an auger
and bit, a saw, and God knows what else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Berry shouted suddenly, as he was
arranging the articles in an orderly row on the divan
table, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Joel Lacey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course,&rdquo; Belknap murmured quietly,
coolly, and as if to reprimand Berry for his raised
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
voice. &ldquo;You <i>would</i> want to know. Well, dead or
alive, you&rsquo;ll find her in that strong-box over yonder.
Top left-hand drawer, so to speak! If you
ever knew the combination it isn&rsquo;t the same now.
I changed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo; Berry cried desperately from where
he already stood beside the great door of Whittaker&rsquo;s
wall-safe. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;9031.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry fumbled stupidly with the locks. The
terrible speed of events during the past few hours,
together with the excited, thrilling knowledge of
his own scoop (it had been his idea to put Nadia
up to her piece of acting, which he had to admit
had been beautifully done on her part) had reduced
the still ingenuous Berry to a trembling,
weakened condition of hand and eye. Stebbins,
whose emotional flights limited themselves to rage
and suspicion, took the job from him. Under his
stolid fingers the blocks fell quickly, expertly into
place. And, on the final number, the heavy door
sprang. The two men slowly swung it back.</p>
<p>Joel was there. She lay in a tumbled, cramped
heap among a litter of papers on the safe bottom.
There was no least sign of life&mdash;and there was an
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
odor of chloroform. From her attitude it appeared
unlikely she had ever regained consciousness
since being thrown into the airtight compartment.
They lifted her to the couch. Belknap kept his
eyes averted.</p>
<p>Julian chose this particular moment to appear.
He was shouting something about the doors of the
wine cellars being locked and no keys to be found&mdash; He
stopped, looked, and, in another flash, was on
his knees beside Joel, his arms around her, calling
her name. It took Berry every ounce of extra
strength to tear Julian free and fling him away on
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Keep off</i>, you fool. Give the child air. She
is dying for lack of air&mdash;just that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry, with Stebbins&rsquo; clumsy help, rendered such
first aid as one gives the drowning. Julian hovered
near them muttering a frantic rigmarole of endearments
for Joel, and ugly curses for humanity
in general, Berry in particular. Two policemen,
large and unresponsive, kept a firm guard on Belknap
who sat stone-motionless, apparently absorbed
in his bound hands lying limply before him on the
table. He remained breathlessly still, until at last&mdash;it
seemed forever&mdash;Joel, almost invisibly at
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
first, and then visibly, drew a breath, stirred, and
faintly stiffened with renewed life as a Japanese
pulp flower opens to water. Then, in unison with
her, Belknap too breathed, stirred, shifted his position.
Berry saw, and as he quietly lifted Joel into
Julian&rsquo;s arms, felt a pang of sympathy for the great
man he had so long admired and envied. How are
the mighty fallen. But he had only to look at
Joel&rsquo;s face, and Julian&rsquo;s, to lose every iota of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, boy, carry her upstairs. Wrap her up
good and warm; and give her some hot brandy, if
you can find any. She&rsquo;ll be as right as rain in no
time, mark my words for it. And, what&rsquo;s more,
it&rsquo;s going to be plain sailing for you two from now
on. Remember that, and don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; He
tapped the Diary with a meaning forefinger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a closed book; you know what I mean. Easy there,
don&rsquo;t fall.&rdquo; He turned to question Belknap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come across, Belknap. <i>Talk.</i> Or shall
we run you up to town for that? Room 27 at
Headquarters is a fine place to talk. As you
should know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belknap, examining his folded hands with meticulous
interest, spoke sidewise through a lifted
corner of his mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can the rough stuff, Berry. It won&rsquo;t get you
anywhere with me, as <i>you</i> should know. What&rsquo;s
eating you? Curiosity? Yes, I killed &rsquo;em. Do
I <i>have</i> to say it? Oh, don&rsquo;t let it worry your poor
weak intellect that you haven&rsquo;t the right man.
You have. How many did I murder? I lost
count. You add &rsquo;em up. And don&rsquo;t for God&rsquo;s
sake ask me why. Why the Hell! Look in that
rotten little Diary there. It&rsquo;ll tell you why and
then some. <i>One</i> of us had to wipe out the litter
before it hatched; to make his world safe&mdash;for
crime. I got in my licks first, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Belknap
would have made a waving gesture with his
right hand but was checked by its anchorage to
his left. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s clear out of this,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I
expect you&rsquo;re champing at the bit to drag me at
your chariot wheels through the streets of Rome.
Well, do it and be damned. Only get it over.&rdquo;
Belknap&rsquo;s eyes, a little sunken in their heavily
shadowed sockets, gleamed feverishly. The lines
in his face had deepened. He looked his age.
&ldquo;When, may I ask, did <i>you</i> catch the cat out of my
bag? I hadn&rsquo;t a notion I&rsquo;d let it out. Thought
I had it pretty well sewed in. Like the Little Red
Hen you must have left a stone in its place. Or
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
<i>she</i> did, the vixen. I should have marked the extra
weight. <i>Christ</i>, the mess I&rsquo;ve made of the perfect
crime; all in my best tradition. And I had it on
toast but for playing with fire. The utter fool I
was to take her into my game when I already had
her so neatly fitted to my boots. Just as I fitted
Violet Mowbray to Blake&rsquo;s, and Durgin to Allan
Galt&rsquo;s, and Thane to&mdash; Take her away,&rdquo; he
shouted suddenly, hoarsely, half rising to his feet.
&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name why leave the carrion about!
Get her false face to Hell out of here or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry came close to Belknap. His face was
white. He gripped the sides of the table between
them till the knuckles of his hands shone; and in
a level, hard voice spoke into Belknap&rsquo;s eyes and
teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, and listen to me for a change!
You&rsquo;ll take a page from <i>my</i> book now. I&rsquo;m not
a proud man, or a boastful one, Ordway Belknap,
one-time Judge, and <i>one-time</i> detective, but this
here is a haul of mine, and you know it. For once
in a lifetime <i>I</i> had a hunch. From the crack of
the whip this morning I had you on the list. As a
<i>guest</i> in this house last night. Don&rsquo;t you see what
a difference that makes in the point of view?
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
You came here too early for safety, my boy, and
you&rsquo;re leaving here too late. It may be true I
didn&rsquo;t downright suspect you until Mdevani and
Lacey caught onto something at sight of your
black number on the wall. But then it took a
psychologist (and that&rsquo;s my strong point) to figure
why they were keeping their mouths shut.
One was scared of her life of you; and the other
cared about you. Right? After that I found
the extra bullet. And I knew right then, as well
as you did, that neither would fit the Mdevani
weapon. We&rsquo;ll prove tomorrow, when it won&rsquo;t
matter a hoot, that they both fit this little gun
of yours.&rdquo; Berry picked up Belknap&rsquo;s 22 and
dropped it again with a clatter that echoed in the
tense stillness of the listening room. Berry was
decidedly working himself into a heat. &ldquo;Then
Lacey remembered the Mowbray name&mdash;and I
saw why the poor little actress had to be bumped
off. She was the only one of your morning&rsquo;s bag
I had to find your motive for. Blake had to go
because he was so much a part of your most recent
legal crime. Yours and the Judge&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit off there,&rdquo; Belknap hissed, his face dark and
threatening, close to Berry&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have you
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
<i>imputing</i> motives. I collided with him in the
dark last night. He knew what we both were
after&mdash;and that <i>I</i> got it. So I got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! That&rsquo;s the way the wind blew, is it?
And after that you strangled the baby doll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before, as it happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>before</i>. A Hell of a lot of difference it
makes when you did it. Too bad I had to come
barging in just about then, before you&rsquo;d finished
off your Damon and Pythias friend. Guess Whittaker
threw his dice so you&rsquo;d play the villain&rsquo;s part
all along. He had it in for you, to my way of
thinking. Clever idea your wall-hole and the
planted gun. But a bit out of the reckoning that
your first shot missed. However, I&rsquo;d have got
you anyway, one shot or two. The holes, by
the way, reminded your girl-friend that she&rsquo;d once
interrupted your investigation in this room at an
embarrassing moment. <i>She</i> lit the Murad, I understand.
Miss Lacey was also reminded that you
mysteriously emerged from no man&rsquo;s land when she
was here in the night. Whereupon it ceased to be
no man&rsquo;s land. And don&rsquo;t think I missed the little
by-play when you tried to convince Miss Mdevani
she hadn&rsquo;t done what she knew she did&mdash;put that
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
carnation in your buttonhole. She was too keen
to try that kind of trick on. I don&rsquo;t know when
you made up your mind to lay the whole pack of
crimes at her door. But I suppose you rifled her
room of her gun and handkerchief for the express
purpose. Damn lucky for you she came across
with the Blake order for you to sprinkle about.
<i>And</i> the drug for Crawford, for you to exchange
<i>en passant</i>. God, you&rsquo;re a beast. Worse than
they come. Why Crawford? Just because it
clinched the case against her? His death to insure
hers? And all the time making eyes at the
woman you were playing for a sucker. Well,
don&rsquo;t ever kid yourself you succeeded in putting it
over on her. She was watching you cut your own
throat. Only wasn&rsquo;t helping give you away until
she had to. Until it was your life or hers. But
with you determined to make it hers she still had
enough guts left to outplay you. For she <i>has</i> outplayed
you. Dead as she lies on that floor, God
rest her soul, she&rsquo;s better off than you are. No,
Dorn was your best bet for a double if you had to
have one. You should have stuck to someone
who couldn&rsquo;t defend himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defend himself!&rdquo; Belknap laughed ferociously,
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
breathing hard. &ldquo;Dorn defend himself!
It is to laugh! About as much chance of his coming
back to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Milton Dorn came back. Above the
strained, ugly, mounting voices of the two men
pitched against each other came the crash of the
window-doors to the terrace, burst forcefully open.
On the sill, exaggerated and unattached against the
swirling mist, stood two of Stebbins&rsquo; uniformed
guards with a sagging body slung between them
from the knees and armpits: like some strange inhabitants
of Davy Jones&rsquo; locker bringing back to
earth a victim too horrible for even the sea to
swallow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; growled one of them apologetically,
dimly conscious of the startled horror in the silenced
room, &ldquo;we found this in the old well down
back. Thought you might need it, Sergeant. So
we brought it along up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s recourse to the neuter in referring
to his burden all too vividly indicated its lifelessness.
Not that it could have possibly been otherwise.
Its face was crushed out of human shape.
The head fell back and off to the side, loosely, as
though the neck were broken. The covering of
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
one leg was savagely torn and the flesh from thigh
to knee bared to the bone. The clothing was stiff
and ungainly with congealed blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak of the Devil!&rdquo; Belknap whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorn, I take it,&rdquo; Berry said with super-gentleness.
He forced an odd laugh. &ldquo;Say, you boys,
next time you make a visit with that kind of visiting
card, come to the front door&mdash;and ring. I
don&rsquo;t like stage entrances. Another of yours?&rdquo;
he asked, turning to look at Belknap, through narrowed
eyes, as no man looks at a man.</p>
<p>Belknap smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>did</i> you guess it, Lieutenant? Yes,
number one. I had to scotch him on the spot
last night when he was trying to slip from under.
Couldn&rsquo;t take any chances on how much he knew.
Talk about your blind witnesses! None of &rsquo;em
even saw me take my little trip to fetch something
from my car last night. Went out on Dorn&rsquo;s
heels, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do from you,&rdquo; Berry said. &ldquo;Not another
word. We&rsquo;ve had enough. Take him to
Glory for me, men. Sergeant,&rdquo; he added to the
stupefied Stebbins, &ldquo;will you give them a ring in
town and say we&rsquo;re on our way&mdash;with the goods.
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
<i>Broad</i>cast it. Tell them to be ready with the
racks and boiling oil. And clean up this mess as
best you can when my back&rsquo;s turned. Run the
bodies down to the morgue in the morning.
There&rsquo;ll be autopsies, I suppose, though God knows
they aren&rsquo;t needed. Come along, you,&rdquo; he said, as
Belknap rose unsteadily to his feet.</p>
<p>But Belknap, with a quick, vicious movement of
his bear-like shoulders, thrust his jailors aside, and
bent over the motionless, shrunken form of Nadia
Mdevani. Even, bending down and using his two
hands as one, he turned her face uppermost. It
was an exquisite and clear-cut face, very quiet,
very perfect, like a medallion or cameo face.
And as devoid of expression. Suddenly Belknap
straightened, threw back his head, and laughed
wildly, breaking into a snatch of song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>&lsquo;She was my woman,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>But she done me wrong.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Belknap,&rdquo; Berry shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
go playing the sentimental fool so late in the
day. I guess <i>she</i> could have sung that song as it
should be sung. And meant it.&rdquo; Pushing Belknap
roughly toward the hall door, Berry turned
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
back to give his final orders. &ldquo;By the way, Sergeant,
I believe there are a few left-overs straying
about the house. I wouldn&rsquo;t care to sleep here
myself and it&rsquo;s likely they wouldn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d better
round &rsquo;em up and take &rsquo;em places. There&rsquo;s
that John, and the girl named Lily, I believe. And
of course Mr. Prentice and Miss Lacey and Mrs.
Crawford&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are most thoughtful, Lieutenant Berry.&rdquo;
Sydney Crawford, in hat and cloak, descended the
stairs toward them. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t have me on your
mind. I&rsquo;m just leaving&mdash;and I have my car.&rdquo;
She was about to pass them, and paused. &ldquo;Thank
you, Mr. Belknap,&rdquo; she said, stiffly, her glazed eyes
rigidly avoiding him, &ldquo;for a thrilling week-end.
And for my precious life which it is a joy to be able
to dispose of as I please. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berry forever after wished he had obeyed his
immediate impulse to detain her. It might have
made the difference between another life and
death. For, three days later, her body came
ashore above Greenwich. It was the only death
directly connected with that memorable week-end
at Thorngate that was entered on the records as
suicide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>But Berry, although it was with a strong feeling
of apprehension and pity that he watched her go
toward the garage, escorted by a kindly and gallant
policeman, was more than anxious to reach
town and deliver up his capture. He drew on his
gauntlet driving gloves, accepted a light for his
fag from the respectful hand of Sergeant Stebbins,
slipped behind the wheel of his old Stutz, and circled
out of the Thorngate drive cold on the stroke
of midnight.</p>
<p class="tb">The following entry from the Diary of Judge
Bertrand Whittaker, was incorporated verbatim
in Berry&rsquo;s written report of the preceding case
given next day to Berry&rsquo;s friend and chief, Inspector
Thomas O&rsquo;Donnell, of the New York Detective
Bureau:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>April 29th &rsquo;31&mdash;Ran into O. B. at the club just
now. Saw him before he saw me. And the very
look of him gave me the inspiration I&rsquo;ve been praying
for. What with revising my will yesterday,
and buying that little gun this morning, I haven&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
been in too good a humor. Not that I mind dying&mdash; Oh,
I&rsquo;ve said it too often. Too many denials
make an affirmative! No, but death is the
least part of it. It&rsquo;s the wait, and the pain. God,
the pain! It took me three shots of morphine to
pull me through a spell last night. And, as I&rsquo;ve also
said before, the way around the wait and the pain
is suicide. But a tame route. And unsavory.
Certainly without thrill. I want thrill. I love it
in my fashion as much as B. ever did. I simply
haven&rsquo;t his genius for devising it. How he has devised
excitement for the two of us! When he deserted
the Bench for the sole purpose of entering
into a destroying pact with me, he the detective
and I the judge, I couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen in my
wildest moments how positively dangerous and evil
he was going to make our lives and our relations to
each other. We&rsquo;ve gone so far with our false witnessing
and our false condemning that we are becoming
terrified of each other and of our too great
knowledge of sin. It&rsquo;s the only way I can explain
the ugly reserves and distrusts that have lately been
thrusting between us. I&rsquo;ve been sorry. It&rsquo;s
spoiled the play. But I hardly wonder. Our two
last cases, particularly the Stanton-Mowbray-Blake,
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
skimmed too close to destruction to be altogether
pleasant. Perhaps it was the thought of
the guillotines we hold over each other&rsquo;s necks, together
with a glimpse of his too handsome wicked
face (proximity to him has always had the power
to rouse in me such black magic as I possess), that
drove the dart of my new scheme between my cerebrum
and cerebellum.</p>
<p>I have kept a fairly accurate record of our
twenty-odd cases since B. and I went into partnership.
Eleven of them led to executions&mdash;that is,
in each, a man or woman paid with death for a
crime they never committed. Yet, of those eleven,
eight <i>confessed</i>. The most diabolical thing about
B.&rsquo;s power is that he can subtly instil his victims
with the exhausted and driven conclusion that to
admit is the most painless way out. In some instances
I even think his hypnotic force is so great
that the person actually <i>believes</i> himself guilty.
Anyway a judge can certainly do no less than impose
the death penalty on a confessed murderer,
can he now?</p>
<p>The publication, or threatened publication, of
these Arabian Nights&rsquo; entertainments&mdash;together
with odds and ends of undiscovered murders committed
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
by various friends and relatives&mdash;should
not only make good sensational reading, but should
bring about an upheaval that might quite conceivably
be climaxed by my own murder. <i>That&rsquo;s</i> my
fresh idea of an escape expressed in so many words!
And however you look at it, it&rsquo;s such a gay, pleasant,
bad game&mdash;and so worthy of my associations
with B.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">And the Devil said to Mr. Legree,</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;I like your style, so wicked and free</p>
<p class="t">Come sit and share my throne with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m all for trying it. And I even dropped
B. a hint of something in the wind as I passed him
by. I think he took alarm. I&rsquo;ll give him a ring,
in a few days, when my plans have matured. It&rsquo;ll
take a bit of planning. There&rsquo;s the rounding up
of half a dozen spicy criminals. Nadia Mdevani
is number one.</p>
<p>My mind&rsquo;s whirling with ideas! I can begin
to see so many little twists I can give the affair&mdash;ironic,
comic, naughty. An especially nice one for
B. himself. It&rsquo;s going to be jolly interesting. And
a good death knell to set the wild echoes flying!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
